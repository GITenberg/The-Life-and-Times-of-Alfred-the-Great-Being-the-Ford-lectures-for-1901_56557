<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The present work contains the lectures delivered by me
on the Ford foundation in Michaelmas Term, 1901. The
lectures are printed substantially as they were delivered,
with the exception that certain passages which were
shortened or omitted in delivery owing to want of time
are now given in full.</p>

<p>In the notes will be found the authorities and arguments
on which the conclusions of the text are based. The notes
occupy a rather large proportion of the book, because
I wished to spare my audience, as far as possible, the
discussion of technical details.</p>

<p>I have not thought it necessary to recast the form of the
lectures. The personal style of address, naturally employed
by a lecturer to his audience, is retained in addressing the
larger audience to which I now appeal.</p>

<p>The objects which I have aimed at in the lectures are
sufficiently explained at the beginning and end of the
lectures themselves, and need not be further enlarged on
here.</p>

<p>In many ways the lectures would no doubt have been
improved, if I had been able to make use of Mr. Stevenson’s
long-expected edition of Asser. On the other hand there
may be advantages in the fact that Mr. Stevenson and
myself have worked in perfect independence of one another.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I have had to speak unfavourably of
some of the recent Alfred literature which has come under
my notice. I am a little jealous for the honour of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
historical scholarship; and I am more than a little jealous
that the greatest name in English history should be considered
a theme on which any one may try his prentice
hand. It suggests the possibility of adding a new chapter
to what I have called ‘that ever-lengthening treatise De
casibus illustrium uirorum’ (<a href="#Page_178">p. 178</a>).</p>

<p>I have, as usual, to thank all the officials of the Clarendon
Press, especially my friend Mr. C. E. Doble, for the interest
and care which they have bestowed upon the work; and
I must also thank the Delegates for so kindly undertaking
the publication of it. The help which I have received in
reference to various points is acknowledged in the book
itself.</p>

<p>For the map I am indebted to the skill of Mr. B. V.
Darbishire.</p>

<p>In the Dedication I have tried to express the gratitude
which I owe for the friendship and intellectual sympathy
of some quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Finally I would record my great obligations to the
electors to the Ford Lectureship for the distinguished
honour which they did me in appointing me to the post
without any solicitation on my part.</p>

<h1>THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALFRED THE GREAT</h1>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<div class="sidenote"><i>In
Memoriam</i>
W. Stubbs.</div>

<p>§ 1. I trust you will not think it inappropriate if
I begin these lectures by paying my humble tribute of
reverence and gratitude to the memory of the great historian
who, since my appointment to this post of Ford’s
Lecturer, has been taken from us. I believe that to him
I am very largely indebted for the honour of appearing
before you to-day<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; and if that were so, it would only be
of a piece with the many acts of kindness and encouragement
which he showed me; encouragement sometimes
couched in that humorous form which he loved, and which
was occasionally misunderstood by those who had not, like
himself, the saving gift of humour. It is not easy to
measure the greatness of his loss. He was unquestionably
one of the most learned men in Europe; one of the few
who could venture to assert an historical negative. If he
declared ‘there is no authority for such a view or statement,’
you knew that there was nothing more to be said.
But even more wonderful than the extent of his learning
was the way in which he could compress it, and bring it
all to bear upon the particular point with which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
dealing. I daresay it has happened to you, as it has often
happened to myself, to read other books and authorities,
and to fancy that one had gained from them fresh facts
and views, and then to go back to Stubbs and find that all
our new facts and views were there already; only, until
we had read more widely ourselves, we had not eyes to
see all that was written there.</p>

<p>§ 2. But with all this, history was never to him mere
erudition. It was, on the one hand, the record of human
experience, a record ‘written for our learning,’ and rich
with unheeded lessons; on the other, it was the gradual
unfolding to human view of the purposes of God, working
themselves out not only in spite of, but often by means
of the weakness and waywardness of the human agents.
And so he views the characters and the course of history,
not, as so many historians do, merely from the outside,
but, if I may so speak, from within. The characters of
history are no mere puppets, to be dressed in picturesque
costumes, and made to strut across the stage of the world;
they ‘are men of like passions with’ us, tempted and
sinning, and suffering, as we are tempted, sin, and suffer;
aspiring and achieving, as we too might aspire and achieve.
‘History,’ he says, ‘cannot be well read as a chess problem,
and the man who tries to read it so is not worthy to read
it at all<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.’ And so we have in the Prefaces to Hoveden,
Benedict of Peterborough, the Itinerarium Ricardi, and
Walter of Coventry, those wonderful studies of the characters
of Henry II, Richard I, and John, which must
always remain as masterpieces of historical portraiture.
In the same way the course of history at large is no
mere complex of material and mechanical laws; it yields
no countenance to that ingenious philosophy which is ‘so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
apt,’ as he contemptuously says, ‘to show that all things
would have been exactly as they are if everything had
been diametrically opposite to what it was<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.’ ‘The ebb
and flow of the life of nations is seen,’ he says, ‘to depend
on higher laws, more general purposes, the guidance of
a Higher Hand<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.’ And so we have those wonderful
summaries which conclude the second and third volumes
of his Constitutional History, the finest specimens I know of
historical generalisations controlled by an absolute mastery
of all the facts.</p>

<p>§ 3. And here we find the secret of his unfailing hopefulness.
The last words of that same second volume must,
I think, have dwelt in the hearts of all who have ever
read them; where, after speaking of the luxury, the
selfishness, the hardness of the fourteenth century, and the
lust, the cruelty, the futility of the fifteenth, he concludes:
‘Yet out of it emerges, in spite of all, the truer and
brighter day, the season of more general conscious life,
higher longings, more forbearing, more sympathetic, purer,
riper liberty.’ While those who remember the Commemoration
Sermon which he preached at the late Queen’s first
jubilee will know that he brought the same wise spirit of
hopefulness to the history of our own day. There was
much in the tendencies of modern thought and of modern
society which, to a man of his strong convictions as a
Christian and a Churchman, was justly repugnant. But
in his case ‘experience,’ and history, the record of experience,
had ‘worked hope.’ Some of us may perhaps
remember how in one of his public lectures he himself
quoted the Psalmist’s words: ‘I said, It is mine own infirmity:
but I will remember the years of the right hand
of the Most Highest.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 4. It is only of his character as an historian that I have
a right to speak to you from this place; but perhaps you
will forgive me if, as a Churchman, I just briefly put on
record my sense of the loss which the Church of England
has suffered in his death; though only the rulers of the
Church can fully estimate the value to the Church in
these anxious days of that ripe judgement, based on so
unique a mastery of the history both of Church and State.
We should be false to his own wise spirit of sober hopefulness
if we did not trust that others may be raised up
in turn to take his place.</p>

<p>With these few words of introduction, I turn to the
proper subject of these present lectures.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
present
lectures.</div>

<p>§ 5. When the electors to the Ford Lectureship did
me the great honour of offering me the lectureship, coupled
with the informal suggestion that the present set of
lectures might appropriately be devoted to some subject
connected with King Alfred, I warned them, in the letter
in which I accepted both the offer and the suggestion, that
it was unlikely that on such a well-worked period of
English history I should be able to offer anything very
new or original. That warning I must now repeat to you.
If in the course of our labours I can remove some of the
difficulties and confusions which have gathered round the
subject, and put in a clearer light some points which have
been imperfectly apprehended, that will be all that I can
aspire to. For the rest I must be content to put in my
own words, and arrange in my own way, what has been
previously written by others or by myself; and these
lectures may rank as Prolegomena, in the sense in which
the late Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, remarked
that Dean Alford seemed to have used that word in his
edition of the Greek Testament, viz. ‘things that have
been said before.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prevalence
of
uncritical
statements
about
Alfred.</div>

<p>§ 6. But if I cannot tell you much that is very new,
I hope that what I shall tell you may be approximately
true. I shall not tell you, as a recent writer has done,
that ‘by his invention of the shires [Alfred] anticipated
the principles of the County Council legislation of ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
centuries later<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.’ For, in the first place, Alfred did not
‘invent the shires’; and secondly, if I may quote a letter
of my friend the Rev. C. S. Taylor, whose papers on
Anglo-Saxon topography and archaeology<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> are well known
to and appreciated by historical students, it ‘is surely a mistake
to make Alfred, as some folks seem to do, into a kind
of ninth century incarnation of a combined School Board
and County Council.’ Yes, it is surely a mistake; and no
less surely is it a mistake to make him into a nineteenth
century radical with a touch of the nonconformist conscience<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>;
or a Broad-Churchman with agnostic proclivities<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.
Nor shall I, with another recent writer, revive old Dr.
Whitaker’s theory that St. Neot was an elder brother of
Alfred, identical with the somewhat shadowy Athelstan
who was under-king of Kent at any rate from 841 to
851<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. For, firstly, it is very doubtful whether Athelstan
was really Alfred’s brother, and not rather his uncle<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>;
and secondly, as we shall see later on, St. Neot is an even
more shadowy person than the under-king with whom Dr.
Whitaker and Mr. Edward Conybeare would identify him;
so shadowy indeed, as almost to justify an attitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
scepticism towards him as complete as that which Betsy
Prig ultimately came to adopt towards the oft-quoted Mrs.
Harris:—‘I don’t believe there never was no such person.’
I shall not repeat William of Malmesbury’s confusion of
John the Old Saxon with John Scotus Erigena<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and of
Sighelm, Alfred’s messenger, with Sighelm, bishop of
Sherborne in the following century<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; or Henry of Huntingdon’s
assertion<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that Æthelwulf before his accession
was bishop of Winchester. I shall not speak of an ‘<i>Earl</i>
of Berkshire’ in the ninth century, nor tell you that
Alfred’s Jewel is in the Bodleian<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, or that ‘the Danes
made their first appearance on these shores in 832<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.’ Nor
shall I tell you that ‘Alfred supplied chapter-headings
and prefixed tables of contents to each of his authors, an
improvement hitherto unheard of in literary work, which,
simple as it seems now to us, betokened in its first conception
no small literary genius<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>’; for I happen to have
had better opportunities than most people of knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that, in the case of Bede’s Ecclesiastical History, the
chapter-headings were there long before Alfred undertook
the work of translation. The same is true of Pope Gregory’s
Dialogues, and of his Pastoral Care. The only works to
which the above remarks could apply would be the Boethius
and the Orosius translations; and even there we cannot be
sure that the Latin MSS. used by Alfred had no chapter-headings;
certainly the St. Gallen and Donaueschingen
MSS. of Orosius have capitula<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, though, owing to the free
way in which Alfred dealt with the Orosius, the Latin and
Anglo-Saxon capitula do not correspond very closely. And
the same is true of some Boethius MSS.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is in truth a
little disheartening to have all these old confusions and myths
trotted out once more at this time of day as if they were
genuine history. The fact is that there has been, if I may
borrow a phrase from the Stock Exchange, a ‘boom’ in
things Alfredian lately; and the literary speculator has
rushed in to make his profit. Along with a few persons
who are real authorities on the subjects with which they
deal, eminent men in other departments of literature and
life are engaged to play the parts which the ducal chairman
and the aristocratic director play in the floatation of
a company. They may not know very much about the
business in hand, but their names look well on a prospectus.
The result is not very creditable to English scholarship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
learning
non-professional.</div>

<p>§ 7. I would not be understood as wishing to confine
the writing of English history to a small body of experts.
It is one of the great characteristics of English learning
that it has never been the monopoly of a professional
or professorial caste, as in Germany, but has been contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to by men of every, and of no profession. To
this fact it owes many of its best qualities—its sanity and
common sense, its freedom from fads and far-fetched
fancies, its freshness and contact with reality—qualities
in which German learning, in spite of its extraordinary
depth and solidity, is sometimes conspicuously wanting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Qualities
required
for writing
English
history.</div>

<p>Still the fact remains, that to write on any period of
early English history requires something more than the
power of construing the Latin Chroniclers in the light of
classical Latin, and of spelling out the Saxon Chronicle
with the aid of a translation<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. It needs some knowledge
of the general lie of English history, and of the main line
of development of English institutions; it needs some
grasp of the relations of England to the Continent during
the period in question, some power of weighing and comparing
different kinds of historical evidence, some acquaintance
with the existing literature on the subject<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. It must
be confessed that in many of the recent writings on King
Alfred we look for these requirements in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need for
a critical
survey
of the
sources.</div>

<p>§ 8. But, seeing that so many uncritical statements on
the subject of King Alfred are abroad, it is all the more
imperative that we should begin our work with a critical
survey of the materials at our disposal. We shall find
them in many respects disappointingly scanty and incomplete.
But we must look that fact full in the face, and
must not allow ourselves to supply the defects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
evidence by the luxuriance of a riotous imagination. The
growth of legend is largely due to the unwillingness of
men to acquiesce in inevitable ignorance, especially in the
case of historical characters like Alfred, whom we rightly
desire to honour and to love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
own
works.</div>

<p>§ 9. The first place in our list of authorities for the life
of Alfred must be given to his own literary works. It is
true that the evidence which they furnish is mostly indirect,
but it is, for that very reason, all the more secure.
It might be thought that the fact that these works consist
almost entirely of translations would prevent them from
throwing much light on the life and character of their
author. In reality the contrary is the truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
evidence
largely
indirect; but also
direct.</div>

<p>It was very acutely remarked by Jaffé<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that if, as
Ranke alleged, the fact that Einhard’s Life of Charles the
Great is obviously modelled on Suetonius’ Life of Augustus
detracts somewhat from its value as an original portrait,
on the other hand the careful way in which Einhard alters
those phrases of his model which were not strictly applicable
to his own hero, brings out many a fine shade in
Charles’ character of which we should otherwise have
been ignorant. In the same way, the manner in which
Alfred deals with the works which he translated reveals
as much of his mind as an original work could do. And
this is not merely the case with works like the Orosius,
the Boethius, and the Soliloquies of St. Augustine, in which
he allowed himself a large freedom in the way of adaptation
and addition. Even in the Cura Pastoralis, in which
he keeps extremely close to his original, there are little
touches which seem to give us glimpses into the king’s
inmost soul<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>And sometimes the evidence is not indirect but direct.
The well-known and oft-quoted Preface to the Cura
Pastoralis is an historical document of the first importance;
and, as a revelation of the author’s mind, it holds,
as Professor Earle has said<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, the first place. Next to this
would come the Preface to his Laws, which, for the purposes
of this section, may be included among his literary
works, and the mutilated preface to the translation of the
Soliloquies of St. Augustine. On all these literary works
I shall have much to say later on<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; I only mention them
here in their character of historical authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Saxon
Chronicle.</div>

<p>§ 10. The next place in our list of authorities belongs
on every ground to the Saxon Chronicle. Of the relation
of Alfred to the Chronicle I may also have something to
say subsequently<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. But I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> given my
reasons for believing that the idea of a national chronicle,
as opposed to local annals, was due to the inspiration of
Alfred, and was carried out under his supervision; and
I have said that ‘I can well fancy that he may have
dictated some of the later annals which describe his own
wars.’ For the former view the high authority of the late
bishop of Oxford<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> may be quoted, while as to the second
point Professor Earle writes<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>: ‘I never can read the annals
of 893-897 without seeming to hear the voice of King
Alfred.’ My friend Sir Henry Howorth indeed has a very
low opinion of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; and as regards
the early part of the Chronicle I am entirely at one with
Sir Henry Howorth. I have more than once<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> recorded
my conviction of the futility of the attempts of Dr. Guest,
Mr. Freeman, and Mr. Green, to base an historical account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the Saxon Conquest of Britain on the unsubstantial
dreamwork of traditions embodied in the earlier entries of
the Chronicle. But Sir Henry Howorth seems to me to
carry his scepticism down to an unduly late period. Anyhow,
for the period covered by the public activity of
Alfred, 868-901, the Chronicle is as nearly contemporary
with the events which it records as any written history is
likely to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meagreness
of the
Chronicle.</div>

<p>But granting that the Chronicle is, for this period,
trustworthy as far as it goes; it must be confessed that it
is often disappointingly meagre. Of the thirty-four years
868-901, three are entirely vacant<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. Eight have merely
brief entries of a line or two recording the movements of
the Danish army or <i>here</i>; and of these eight entries the last
three have nothing to do with England, being concerned
with the doings of the <i>here</i> on the Continent<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. Two
other very brief entries deal with the sending of couriers
to Rome, and with certain obits<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. The date of Alfred’s
death is barely (and probably wrongly) recorded<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; not
a word as to its place or circumstances. And there is
a singular dearth of any note of panegyric like that which
meets us in the records, meagre as they are, of the reigns
of Athelstan, Edmund, and Edgar<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. In regard to the
doings of Alfred this may be due to the influence of
Alfred himself; but on the occasion of his death one
might have expected, if not the worthy tributes which
Ethelwerd and Florence insert at that point<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, at least
some recognition of the work which he did. But there is
nothing beyond the rather cold statement that ‘he was
king over the whole Anglekin, except that part which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
under the power of the Danes.’ One would fain hope
that this reticence was due to the feeling so finely expressed
by Hallam where he speaks of Sir Thomas More as one
‘whose name can ask no epithet<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.’ But I do not think
it was; and I rather doubt whether Alfred’s greatness
was fully appreciated in his own day, except by one or two
of those in his immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charters
not
numerous.</div>

<p>§ 11. In charters, which often supplement so usefully
the deficiencies of formal histories, the reign of Alfred is
far from rich. The time, indeed, was not favourable to
the preservation of documents. Of the destruction of
title deeds owing to the troubles of the time we have a
striking and pathetic instance<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>:—Burgred, king of Mercia,
had, for a consideration, granted land to a man named
Cered, with remainder to his wife after his death. In
course of time Cered died, and his widow Werthryth
desired to go to Rome, and to dispose of the land to her
husband’s kinsman, Cuthwulf. The charter of the original
grant to Cered had however been carried off by the Danes;
and Werthryth consequently could not prove her title.
She accordingly appeared before a Mercian Witenagemót
held under Æthelred, Alfred’s son-in-law, as ealdorman of
Mercia, and made oath to this effect. Whereupon Æthelred
and the Witan allowed a new charter to be made out
securing the land to Cuthwulf.</p>

<p>And the strong-handed took advantage of this confusion
to annex the property of their neighbours. Thus in 896
Æthelred of Mercia, with Alfred’s permission, held a
Witenagemót at Gloucester, in order ‘to right many men
both clerical and lay in respect of lands and other things
[wrongfully] withheld from them’; a measure no doubt
necessitated by the great campaign of 892-895. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Werferth, bishop of Worcester, complained that he had
been robbed of woods at Woodchester, which had belonged
to his see ever since the days of Æthelbald of
Mercia<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. If this was the experience of a powerful bishop,
a special friend of the king himself, we may imagine the
dangers to which lesser men were exposed. Fortunately
among the documents which have been preserved is Alfred’s
own will, a most interesting relic, on which something will
be said later<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asser’s
work. Suspicious
points. The work
consists
of two
parts,
(<i>a</i>) annalistic, (<i>b</i>) biographical. Crude
arrangement.</div>

<p>§ 12. We come now to what is the greatest <i>crux</i> in our
whole subject, viz. the so-called life of Alfred which bears
the name of Asser. It is obvious that if this work is
genuine, it is an historical authority of the highest interest
and importance. On the other hand, it must be confessed
that there are features in it which do excite suspicion.
Apart from difficulties of detail, some of which will come
up for subsequent consideration, the general form of the
work is most extraordinary, and high authorities have
pronounced that, in its present shape, it cannot possibly
be original<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. The work is made up, as most students know,
of at least two distinct elements. There is a series of
annals extending from 851 to 887 inclusive, which are for
the most part parallel to the corresponding annals of the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. I deliberately choose a neutral
phrase ‘parallel to,’ as I do not wish, at this stage, to prejudge
the question whether the Latin or the Saxon annals
are the more original. Into this series of annals are inserted,
at various points, sections of biographical matter, of
which the earliest refer to Æthelwulf and Æthelbald, one
refers to Æthelred, and the remainder to Alfred. In some
cases these biographical sections are introduced by editorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
head-links (if I may borrow a word from the Chaucerian
specialists), consisting as a rule of very florid and elaborate
metaphors<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. But the way in which these biographical
sections are inserted is so inconsequent and inartistic, that
one is sometimes almost inclined to think that the compiler,
while keeping his annals (as he could hardly help doing) in
chronological order, cut up his biographical matter into
strips, put the strips into a hat, and then took them out in
any order which chance might dictate; much as a famous
Oxford parody supposed the names of successful candidates
in certain pass examinations to be determined<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. It is true
that in Florence of Worcester the biographical matter
identical with that in Asser is woven much more skilfully
into the chronological framework of the story; but, after
careful consideration, I do not think that this implies that
Florence’s Asser was any better arranged than our own.
I attribute the changes to Florence’s own skill and judgement;
and Florence had more of both than some of his
modern critics are willing to allow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excessive
self-assertion
of
the
author.</div>

<p>§ 13. Another general ground of suspicion is, if I may
so say, psychological; and I may illustrate what I mean
by a little personal reminiscence. Some few years ago
I was dining in a college not my own, where one of the
junior fellows told us a somewhat startling tale, prefacing
it with the remark that the incident was unquestionably
true, as it had happened to himself. ‘Ah,’ said the senior
fellow, with the frankness which is one of the privileges of
seniority, ‘whenever a man begins a story in that way,
I always know that some bigger lie than usual is going to
follow.’ Now it is at least curious that our author so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
constantly lays stress on the fact that he had himself
witnessed some of the most striking of the things which
he relates, or at least had heard them from those who had
seen them. Thus he had frequently (‘saepissime’) witnessed
Alfred’s skill in hunting<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>; he had himself seen the little
book containing the daily offices and Psalms and prayers
which Alfred always carried about with him<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>; he had with
‘his very own eyes’ often seen Alfred’s maternal grandmother,
Eadburh<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>; ‘with his very own eyes’ again he
had seen the solitary thorn which marked the site of the
battle of Ashdown<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>; he had himself surveyed the site of
the fort of Cynwit, and verified its capacities for defence<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.
He gives us to understand that he, with others, had
witnessed Alfred’s mysterious attacks of illness<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>; that he
had not only seen, but read the letters which Alfred received
from the patriarch of Jerusalem<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; that he had seen
in Athelney Monastery the young Dane whom Alfred was
educating there in the monastic life<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. So he had heard
from various persons different opinions as to the relative
guilt of the parties in the alleged rebellion of Æthelbald<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>;
he had conversed with many who had seen Offa’s daughter
Eadburh, the Jezebel of Wessex history, in her dishonoured
and mendicant old age at Pavia<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; while the story of her
crimes in Wessex, which deprived all her successors of the
title of queen, he had heard from Alfred himself<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. He
had heard from eye-witnesses how Æthelred at Ashdown
refused to engage till mass was finished<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, and of the
military skill of Abbot John the Old Saxon from those
who knew him<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Now in all these things there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
impossible, or even improbable. It is only the constant
asseveration which excites suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frankish
element
in Asser;
no ground
for suspicion.</div>

<p>§ 14. One general objection which has sometimes been
brought against our author is, I am convinced, without
foundation:—I mean the presence in him of a certain
Frankish element. He uses certain Frankish words, <i>vassallus</i>,
<i>indiculus</i> (a letter; both these words puzzled the
scribes a good deal), <i>comes</i> (in the sense of ealdorman),
<i>senior</i> (a lord, seigneur), and possibly others<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. So too the
story how Eadburh ‘put her foot in it,’ if I may use the
phrase, with Charles the Great<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, and of her subsequent
fate, evidently reflects the gossip of the Carolingian Courts.
It is possible that the story of Æthelbald’s incestuous
marriage<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> comes from the same source; as, with the exception
of Asser, the only contemporary authorities in
which it is found are Frankish<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>; so too, perhaps, the
judgement on Arnulf’s conduct in deposing Charles the
Fat<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, and the more correct form Carloman, as against
the Carl of the Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. But when we consider that
two at least of Alfred’s principal literary and educational
coadjutors, Grimbald and John the Old Saxon, came from
different parts of the Carolingian empire, that Æthelwulf
married a Frankish wife, stayed some time at the Frankish
Court<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, and had, as the epistles of Lupus of Ferrières<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
show, a Frankish secretary<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, that some of these words
occur in English charters<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, where likewise they probably
bear witness to the influence of Frankish scribes, we shall
see that there were plenty of channels through which these
Frankish elements might find their way into the biography
of an English king. Moreover, if we should come to the
conclusion that the book is mediately or immediately the
work of Asser, we may be inclined to connect this element
in it with a statement quoted by Leland from a lost life of
Grimbald<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, that Asser was one of the ambassadors deputed
to bring Grimbald to England<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. The description of Paris
also looks as if it might rest on personal knowledge<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Detailed
objections;
the
Diocese of
Exeter.</div>

<p>§ 15. Of the objections in detail which have been
brought against our author, the most important perhaps
relates to his statement that Alfred gave him ‘Exeter with
the diocese belonging to it both in Cornwall and Saxony,’
i.e. Wessex<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. Mr. Wright<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> thought that this was conclusive
evidence that the work was later than the transference
of the united see of Cornwall and Devonshire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Exeter, under Edward the Confessor. I shall show presently
that there is evidence, both external and internal, for
the existence of our Asser about 975. Meanwhile, I would
point out that under the year 875 the Welsh Annals record
the drowning of Dumgarth, king of Cornwall<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, though it
gives one a little start to realise that there were kings in
Cornwall as late as the last quarter of the ninth century<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>;
and we know from the Chronicle that in 877 Alfred recovered
Exeter from the Danes. Now the state of affairs
in South Wales which Asser represents<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> as determining
him, at any rate in part, to accept Alfred’s invitation, in
the hope of securing his protection for St. David’s, clearly
refers to a period 877 × 885. Rotri Mawr is obviously dead,
as his sons only are spoken of, and Rotri Mawr was slain
in 877; while Howel, son of Rhys, king of Glewissig, is
spoken of as alive; and he is probably the Howel who
died at Rome in 885<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, having gone there, it is likely,
in expiation of a crime, of which the record is preserved in
the Book of Llandaff<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. It seems to me not unlikely that
in view of the events of 875 and 877, Alfred may have
wished to place the districts round Exeter under episcopal
supervision, without necessarily intending to create a
definite diocese, and may have thought a Celtic-speaking
prelate likely to be more effective than an Englishman<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>;
for at this time the Bristol Channel was not either physically
or linguistically a serious barrier between the Celts on
either side of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When did Asser
become a
bishop?</div>

<p>Whether Asser was already a bishop when he first came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to Alfred is difficult to determine. He is often spoken of
as bishop of St. David’s. Novis, or Nobis, bishop, or, as
Asser in the passage referred to above patriotically calls
him, archbishop of St. David’s, died, according to the Welsh
Annals, in 873, after a rule of thirty-three years<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. His immediate
successor was Llunwerth or Llwmbert<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>; but when
the latter died I have not succeeded in satisfying myself<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mention
of Asser
in the
Cura Pastoralis.</div>

<p>Confirmation of the grant of Exeter to Asser is sometimes
sought in the fact that Alfred, in the Preface to the
Cura Pastoralis, speaks of Asser as ‘<i>my</i> bishop,’ at a time
when Asser cannot have held his later diocese of Sherborne,
as one of the copies of Alfred’s Cura Pastoralis was actually
addressed to Wulfsige, Asser’s predecessor in that see.
But if Asser was bishop of St. David’s when he came to
Alfred, I should feel myself precluded from using this
argument, for I could not regard it as impossible that
Alfred should speak of Asser as ‘my bishop’ in respect of
his Welsh bishopric, seeing that Asser expressly says that
Hemeid, king of Dyfed, had commended himself to
Alfred; or he might be called ‘my bishop’ in regard to
the position which he held in Alfred’s service<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Argument from the
mention
of Asser’s
illness.</div>

<p>§ 16. Another objection has been based on the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in which Asser relates how, at the close of his first visit to
Alfred, he promised to return in six months’ time, and give
a definite answer to the king’s proposals; but on his way
home, he says, ‘I was seized in the city of Winchester by
a troublesome fever, in which I lay for a year and a week’;
until Alfred sent letters to inquire why he had not kept
his promise<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. Now it has been argued that it is quite
impossible that Asser should have been for over a year at
Winchester without Alfred knowing about it. On the
other hand, my late friend, Mr. Park Harrison, who, in
spite of his advanced age, kept up his interest in these matters
to the very end, called on me only a few weeks before his
death, and argued that this same passage showed that
Alfred could have had but little to do with Winchester,
and therefore it was an impertinence of Winchester to
attempt to monopolise the millenary celebration. As a
matter of fact both arguments are baseless, and rest on
a mistranslation. For in the passage cited, the words ‘in
which’ (in qua), refer not to the city of Winchester, but to
the fever. It is quite evident, I think, from the context
that though it may have been at Winchester that Asser
was attacked by the fever, yet he managed somehow to
reach St. David’s, and that it was there that Alfred’s
letters reached him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corruption
of
the text
of Asser, largely
due to
editors.</div>

<p>§ 17. But before we can judge fairly of the work before
us, we must try to do something to rescue the text from
the very parlous condition in which it has come down to
us. Indeed, with the exception of Ethelwerd’s Chronicle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
hardly any work connected with Early English history has
been textually so unfortunate as Asser. The only known
manuscript of any antiquity perished almost entirely in the
great Cottonian fire of 1731; the two existing manuscripts
are paper copies of the sixteenth century. For our knowledge
of the ancient Cottonian MS. we are dependent
mainly on Wise’s edition of 1722; an excellent work for
the time at which it was produced, but that it is not
scrupulously accurate, according to modern notions, is
proved by the fact that, whereas the facsimile given by
Wise himself of the beginning of the MS. writes the
name of Alfred’s birthplace, Uuanating, the text prints
it Wanading. Moreover, the work has been shamefully
tampered with by editors. Apart from longer interpolations,
of which I shall speak presently, numberless smaller additions
have been introduced into the text from the so-called
Annals of Asser or of St. Neot<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, a compilation of the
eleventh or twelfth century<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, largely based it is true on
Asser for the period 851-887, and therefore available,
within proper limits, like the works of other authors who
have made use of Asser, for purposes of textual criticism;
but not to be used, as has been done, for the wholesale
depravation of the text. Even the editors of the Monumenta
Historica Britannica were content to place these
additions in brackets, instead of removing them altogether.
Consequently they are often quoted by modern writers as if
they were part of the original Asser.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Florence
of Worcester’s
use of
Asser.</div>

<p>Of writers who have made use of Asser the most valuable,
for our purposes, is Florence of Worcester. Very often
he furnishes us with what is evidently the true reading<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>,
in one case at least a passage of some length can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
recovered from his pages, which has been dropped out of
our present text of Asser merely owing to homoioteleuton<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.
But even Florence must be used with caution for textual
purposes. For just as his greater skill in composition led
him (as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>) to rearrange the materials with
which Asser furnished him, so his better taste and greater
command of Latin led him to revise and prune the language
of his author. Moreover, in certain cases, Florence has
corrected and supplemented Asser by the direct use of
the Saxon Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. It must not therefore always be
assumed that because Florence’s reading is better than
Asser’s, it is therefore more original. Conversely, though
rarely, Asser enables us to correct the text of Florence<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>It is very curious that though Florence shows, by substituting
the name Asser for the pronoun of the first
person wherever it occurs, that he accepted Asser’s authorship
of the work, he should place Asser’s death in 883,
while continuing to use his narrative for four years longer.</p>

<p>Of the use of Asser by Simeon of Durham I shall have
something to say presently<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Oxford
interpolation.</div>

<p>§ 18. Of the longer interpolations alluded to above, the
first that must go is, of course, the famous passage about the
University of Oxford<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. This passage is a fine illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of the remark, made in this place by my brilliant predecessor,
Professor Maitland, that the earliest form of
inter-university sports seems to have been a competition in
lying. The different phases of that competition have been
traced by Mr. James Parker in the first two chapters of
his Early History of Oxford<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, and need not detain us here.
This passage made its first appearance in the text of Asser
under Camden’s auspices in 1603. It is much to be
regretted that so worthy a name should be connected with
so questionable a transaction<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. I will only add that the
use of the one word ‘Diuus’ instead of ‘Sanctus’ stamps
the passage as a post-renaissance forgery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The story
of the
cakes.</div>

<p>§ 19. The next passage which must go is what I must
be pardoned for once more<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> calling the silly story about
the cakes, and the yet more silly story of the tyranny and
callousness of Alfred in the early days of his reign<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. I hope
to show later<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> how utterly inconsistent both these stories
are with the genuine history of the reign. Here I need
only say that the passage was introduced into our text by
Archbishop Parker from the so-called Annals of Asser. It
comes ultimately, as stated in the passage itself, from
some life of St. Neot which I have not yet succeeded in
identifying.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interpolation
at 877.</div>

<p>§ 20. I have pointed out in another place<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that the
printed text of Asser contains two accounts of the events
of the year 877<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. With the exception of a few words
relating to the division of Mercia by the Danes, neither of
these versions, according to Wise, existed in the oldest MS.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
That they were not in Florence’s MS. of Asser seems
indicated by the fact, that this is one of the annals in
which he resorts directly to the Saxon Chronicle. They
therefore must also be expunged. I still, however, retain
the conviction that the former of the two versions, though
not traceable higher than Roger of Wendover in the
thirteenth century, is yet perfectly genuine as history, and
furnishes a valuable supplement to the account of the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earlier
interpolations. Story of
Alfred’s
illness.</div>

<p>§ 21. So far our task has been comparatively simple.
We have only had to remove what are obviously later
accretions. But the question must now be faced whether
the text, as we can prove it to have existed about the year
974, had not already suffered from the hand of the interpolator.
From this point of view the most suspicious
passage is that which describes the mysterious illness with
which Alfred is said to have been attacked at his wedding-feast<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.
This passage has already been severely criticised
by Pauli<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, though he has not exhausted all the arguments
which can be brought against it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analysis.</div>

<p>In the first place it is entirely out of position. Though
it refers to Alfred’s wedding, which has already been given,
probably correctly, under 868, when Alfred was about
twenty years old, it is inserted between the events of the
year 884<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and those of 886. The substance of the story is
as follows:—During the marriage festivities Alfred was
suddenly attacked by an intolerable pain, from which he has
suffered, as those who daily see it know, without intermission,
from his twentieth to his fortieth year, or longer.
No one could trace its origin. Some thought it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
‘fascination,’ that is, the evil eye, due to the applause of
the multitude; others, that it was the envy of the devil;
others, some strange kind of fever; others, the disease
called ‘ficus,’ from which he had suffered from his infancy.
Once, when he was hunting in Cornwall, he turned aside
to pray in a church, where St. Guerier reposes, and now
also St. Neot rests, and entreated that some lighter affliction
might be substituted for that from which he was suffering;
such, however, as would not be externally apparent, like
blindness or leprosy, so as to make him contemptible and
incapable of discharging his functions. Shortly afterwards
he was divinely healed of the ‘ficus.’ Though, indeed,
this very ‘ficus’ had been given him in answer to prayer;
for, in the first flower of his youth, before his marriage,
feeling the assaults of carnal desire, he would often rise
secretly and visit churches and relics of the saints, praying
that God would strengthen him by sending him some
infirmity, such, however, as would not make him unworthy
or incapable in worldly matters. In answer to this prayer
he shortly after received the ‘ficus,’ from which he suffered
for many years, until it was removed by prayer. But alas,
on its removal a worse affliction came upon him at his
marriage which lasted from his twentieth to his forty-fifth
year without intermission; and even if it leaves him
for a single hour, the fear and horror of it never quit him,
but render him, as he deems, almost useless in things
divine and human.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inconsistencies
in the
story. Improbability
of the
story.</div>

<p>§ 22. It would be difficult to cram more inconsistencies
into so short a space. First of all, though the whole point
of the story is to show that the wedding-feast disease was
different from, and in substitution for, the ‘ficus,’ the
writer ineptly says, that some people thought it was the
‘ficus.’ This is inserted in order to introduce the statement
that Alfred had suffered from the latter disease ‘from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
infancy.’ Then, after telling how it was removed by prayer
at the Cornish shrine, he adds that this same disease was
sent in answer to prayer, when Alfred was ‘in the flower of
his youth.’ We can hardly place this period earlier than
(say) the seventeenth year (a very different thing from
infancy); yet he suffered from it ‘for many years,’ though
it had certainly ceased before his marriage in his twentieth
year. Again, the condition that the visitation sent should
not be disfiguring or incapacitating, is in one place attached
to the substituted disease, lower down it is attached to the
original trouble. It may be noted that the original disease
does fulfil this condition, the substituted one certainly did
not, seeing that it rendered Alfred ‘almost useless in
things divine and human.’ And yet a main point of the
passage is to illustrate the efficacy of Alfred’s prayers.
Once more, at the beginning of the passage the substituted
disease lasts from Alfred’s twentieth year to rather over his
fortieth; towards the close it extends from the same date
to his forty-fifth year—a very rapid growth. After all
this it seems somewhat tame to remark that leprosy and
blindness hardly come under one’s idea of ‘lighter infirmities.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possible
conflation.</div>

<p>§ 23. In this triumph of ineptitude we may, I think,
detect a conflation of two separate traditions; one of which
represented Alfred as suffering from infancy from a disease
for which in answer to prayer another was substituted;
while, according to the other version, the original disease
was granted in answer to prayer, and though removed by
the same means, only departed to make way for a heavier
visitation. But the whole passage is a concoction in the
worst hagiological manner, to the source of which we are
guided by the mention of St. Neot; for if the legendary
Alfred was reformed by the legendary St. Neot, there is
no doubt that the historical Alfred has been deformed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
an extraordinary degree by the same agency. And in the
present instance we may be glad, I think, to free the
historical Alfred from the atmosphere of morbid religiosity
which taints this whole passage. It may be noted that
Florence, with his usual good sense, has entirely recast
the incident, so as to remove most of the absurdities above
enumerated. Whether the other two passages, which refer
to Alfred’s illness<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>, are also to be rejected is less easy to
say. In one of them the language is very nearly akin to
that of the present passage; but that might be due to the
compiler having made use of it for his own bad purposes.
Personally, I should not be sorry to let all these passages
go; for it seems to me quite inconceivable that Alfred
could have accomplished what he did under the hourly
pressure of incapacitating disease<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. Still we must distinguish
between what is historically doubtful and what is
textually suspicious. There are several things in Asser
which, as we shall see, come under the former category,
though I could not bring them under the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incorporation
in the
text of
glosses and
marginal
notes.</div>

<p>§ 24. One source of the corruption of the text of Asser
is, I think, to be found in the fact that words and phrases,
which were originally interlinear glosses, have become, as
often happens, incorporated with the text<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. In one case the
text of Florence seems to show that the gloss has entirely
expelled the original reading, at least in the printed copies<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<p>In another instance a marginal note by a later scribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
has got into the text. As this case is of some importance
as bearing on the date of the composition, I must ask your
particular attention to it. In the description of Alfred’s
visit to the Cornish shrine, already alluded to, the following
sentence occurs:—‘Cum … ad quandam ecclesiam …
diuertisset, in qua S. Gueryr requiescit, et nunc etiam
S. Neotus ibidem pausat, subleuatus est (erat enim sedulus
sanctorum locorum uisitator, …) diu in oratione prostratus
… Domini misericordiam deprecabatur<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>,’ &amp;c. Here the
words ‘subleuatus est’ can by no possibility be construed,
either with what goes before, or with what follows. Some
time before I saw the meaning of them, I had underlined
these words in my copy of the Monumenta, and noted on
the margin ‘this seems to make nonsense.’ The explanation,
I believe, is this:—The original scribe had stated the repose
of St. Neot’s remains in his Cornish home as a present
fact, ‘ibidem pausat.’ A later scribe notes on the margin
‘subleuatus est,’ ‘he has been taken up’; a word very fitly
used of the taking up a saint’s body from the grave in
order to place it in some elevated shrine, or translate it to
some other abode. A subsequent copyist incorporated the
note with the text, which is again a frequent phenomenon<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
Now the translation of St. Neot to the site which bears
his name in Huntingdonshire took place about the year
974<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. The original text of this passage must therefore be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
anterior to that date; the marginal note, and <i>a fortiori</i> the
MS. on which our present text of Asser rests, must be
subsequent to it. If, as I think, the passage in which
these words occur is itself an interpolation, the evidence for
the genuine text of Asser is thrown yet further back.
However, the argument for <i>a</i> text of Asser earlier than 974,
derived from the use of the present tense ‘pausat,’ is quite
independent both of my explanation of the words ‘subleuatus
est,’ and of my views as to the spurious character of the
passage in which they occur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
evidence
for the
text of
Asser in
the tenth
century.</div>

<p>§ 25. We saw in the last lecture that there was good
evidence for the existence of our text of Asser, apart from
the interpolations made by sixteenth and seventeenth
century editors, about the year 975. Another argument
pointing the same way is derived from the text of Simeon
of Durham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Simeon of
Durham.</div>

<p>In that writer’s Historia Regum there exists a double
recension of the Annals 848-951, both of which are, for
the years 848-888, largely derived, mediately or immediately,
from Asser. The explanation of this curious fact
given by Mr. Thomas Arnold in his interesting and able
introduction to the edition of Simeon in the Rolls Series,
is as follows<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. The earlier recension is the work of a Cuthbertine
monk, writing at Chester-le-Street in the second
half of the tenth century, who drew largely on Asser for
the reign of Alfred, farcing the text however (to use a
liturgical term) with many rhetorical flourishes of his own.
When Simeon, at the beginning of the twelfth century,
embodied the Cuthbertine’s work in his Historia Regum,
his better taste was revolted by these florid insertions, and
he rewrote these annals, not wholly discarding his predecessor’s
work, but using in addition both the original text
of Asser, and also the recent work of Florence of Worcester.
(The fact, which can be demonstrated, that Simeon used
(1) the original text of Asser; (2) Asser as farced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Cuthbertine; (3) Asser as revised by Florence, is one
which I commend to the notice of students of the synoptic
problem<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.) Had Simeon lived to give his work the final
revision, he would no doubt have cancelled the earlier
version of these annals. As it is, his literary executors
embodied both versions; and we may be thankful that
they did so, as they have thereby preserved some interesting
evidence both literary and historical.</p>

<p>If then Mr. Arnold’s theory is correct, as I believe it to
be, we have once more evidence of the existence of a text
of Asser before the end of the tenth century. This however,
though probable, is only a theory. But, even if it
be rejected, the argument of the preceding section remains
unaffected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
palaeographical
evidence
unimportant.</div>

<p>§ 26. Seeing then that we can trace our Asser text
back at least as far as the year 974, the palaeographical
question as to the date of Wise’s MS. becomes comparatively
unimportant. And it is well that it is so;
for the doctors differ to an extraordinary degree. One
morning in Bodley I submitted Wise’s facsimile of the
beginning of his MS. to three eminent palaeographers
of this University. The first was too wary to be caught
by my chaff, and refused to give a definite opinion; the
second said, ‘Not much later than 950’; the third said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
‘Well, it isn’t later than the twelfth century, but it isn’t
very much earlier.’ I believe the general opinion would
place it early in the eleventh century, and this fits in well
enough with what I have tried to prove above, that it is
copied, mediately or immediately, from a MS. which
cannot be later than 974.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conjectural
emendation. Alfred’s
intercourse
with the
East.</div>

<p>§ 27. Something may be done for the text of Asser by
cautious conjectural emendation. There are a certain
number of obvious blunders in it due to the carelessness of
scribes, the ignorance of editors, possibly even to the
mistakes of compositors<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. Most of these are concerned
with minor details. There is one correction however, with
which I will trouble you, as it relates to a point of some
historical interest; and, moreover, converts into a proof of
Asser’s accuracy, what might have been used as an argument
against him, though I am not aware that it has
actually been so used. In the somewhat magniloquent
passage in which are described the extensive relations
which Alfred cultivated with foreign parts, the following
sentence occurs<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>: ‘nam etiam de Hiersolyma Abel patriarcha
[v. l. patriarchae] epistolas … illi directas uidimus
et legimus.’ The passage as it stands is open to two
objections, one historical, the other grammatical. The
historical objection is that no one of the name of Abel
held the patriarchate of Jerusalem during Alfred’s reign;
though our historians go on copying and recopying the
name without ever dreaming of verifying the point. The
grammatical objection is that the passive participle ‘directas’
cries aloud for a preposition of agency. By the addition
of two vowels and the subtraction (if necessary) of another
the passage can be brought into harmony both with history
and grammar, thus: ‘ab Elia patriarcha.’ Elias III<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was patriarch of Jerusalem from 879 to 907<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. In the
earlier of the two versions which occur in Simeon of
Durham the word ‘Abel’ is printed ‘a Bel<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.’ This does
justice to the grammar, but not to the history. In the
later version, Simeon himself, following Florence, omits
the passage altogether. One would be glad to know
whether Florence omitted it because he saw the objections
to which it was open.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of the
Leechbook, and of the
Anglo-Saxon
Martyrology.</div>

<p>I was first put on the track of this correction by the
curious passage of the Leechbook printed by Mr.
Cockayne in the second volume of his interesting Anglo-Saxon
Leechdoms, where the writer, after giving certain
medical recipes, says at the end: ‘all this my Lord Elias,
patriarch of Jerusalem, bade thus say to King Alfred<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.’
As the MS. from which this is taken is, according to
Mr. Cockayne, of the early part of the tenth century<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>,
we are brought very near indeed to Alfred’s time. Moreover
in the Anglo-Saxon Martyrology printed by the same
editor in his work called ‘The Shrine; a collection of
occasional papers on dry subjects,’ two Eastern saints,
martyred in Persia in 341, SS. Milus and Senneus, are
commemorated at November 15<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. These are found in no
Western Calendar, and Mr. Cockayne thinks that the
knowledge of them must have come to England through
Alfred’s intercourse with Elias of Jerusalem. The martyrology,
which is unfortunately incomplete, was not improbably
drawn up by Alfred’s directions, and cannot be
later than his reign, as it mentions St. Oswald’s body as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
resting at Bardney<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, whence it was translated to Gloucester
by Æthelflæd, lady of the Mercians, and her husband
Æthelred, not long after Alfred’s death<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<p>In one instance, I may remark in passing, the editors
have altered Asser’s text for the worse, what the Germans
call ‘Verschlimmbesserung.’ It is the passage where
Athelney monastery is said to be unapproachable ‘nisi
cauticis, aut etiam per unum pontem<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.’ Here ‘cauticis’
has been altered to ‘nauticis.’ But ‘cautica’ is a perfectly
good word, and means causeway, <i>chaussée</i><a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>, a much better
sense than any that can be got out of ‘nauticis<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.’</p>


<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of the
work as
to the
author. He was
a native
of South
Wales.</div>

<p>§ 28. But even when all has been done that criticism
can do for the restoration and purification of the text,
the work still remains a puzzle almost insoluble. What
can we make out as to the author? It is clear that he
was a Celt from South Wales. This is proved partly by
his language and terminology, partly by his knowledge
of South Welsh affairs. As to the former point, he has
the special Celtic use of the terms ‘right-hand’ and ‘left-hand,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to express the ideas of south and north. The Celt
always faced the east, and named the quarters of the
heaven from that point of view. Thus Chippenham is in
the left-hand part of Wiltshire<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. The author’s own home
was to the left and west of Severn<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. The Danes throw
up earthworks on the right-hand side of Reading<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; Sussex
is the region of the right-hand Saxons<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>; and, lastly, all
the regions of the right-hand part of Britannia belonged
to Alfred<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. This does not, however, exclude the use of the
more ordinary words ‘meridianus’ and ‘aquilonaris’ for
south and north<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambiguous
use of
the term
<i>Britannia</i>.</div>

<p>§ 29. The example last cited brings me to another characteristic
of the author’s terminology; viz. his ambiguous
use of the word <i>Britannia</i>, which sometimes means Britain
in the ordinary sense<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, but more often means Wales.
Historians have gone wrong through ignoring this distinction.
Thus Dr. Pauli<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, in the passage just quoted,
takes <i>Britannia</i> in what is to us the ordinary sense. But
that all the southern parts of Britain belonged to Alfred
is so obvious as not to be worth saying. That all the
southern districts of Wales had submitted to Alfred is
a new and most interesting fact. And this clearly is the
meaning; for the statement is introductory to that sketch
of the troubles in South Wales which explains both why
the South Welsh princes commended themselves to Alfred,
and why the author consented to enter his service. Moreover
this use is paralleled again and again in the Book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of Llandaff, a primary South Welsh authority. We find
there Asser’s very phrase ‘dextralis pars Britanniae’ several
times repeated<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. We have the clergy and people, the
inhabitants, the churches, the archbishop, the kings and
princes, the kingdom, the islands, ‘Dextralis Britanniae<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.’
To return to Asser:—Æthelwulf reduces ‘Britannia’ under
Burgred of Mercia<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>; Offa’s dyke divides Mercia from ‘Britannia<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>,’
and finally Asser himself agrees to spend half his
time ‘in Britannia’ and half with Alfred ‘in Saxonia<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.’</p>


<div class="sidenote">Use of the
terms
<i>Saxones</i>
and
<i>Saxonia</i>. Limitation
of
the term
<i>Saxonia</i>.</div>

<p>§ 30. This brings me to my next point. For our author,
as for all branches of the Celtic race, the Germanic tribes
settled in Britain bear the common name of Saxons<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. So
much is this the case that he once writes ‘regnum Orientalium
Saxonum, quod Saxonice Eastengle dicitur<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.’ This
is a mere slip, for in other cases he has ‘Orientales Angli’
quite correctly<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. But it shows how much more natural
the word ‘Saxones’ was to him than the other. So too
their language is ‘Saxonica lingua<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>,’ as opposed to Welsh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which is ‘Britannicus sermo<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>’; a place bears one name,
‘Saxonice,’ ‘in English<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>,’ and another, ‘Britannice,’ ‘in
Welsh<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>’; and we hear of the ‘Saxon’ poems which Alfred
loved from his boyhood<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, and of the ‘Saxon’ books<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, in
which they and other English writings were contained.
So too the country of these tribes is ‘Saxonia<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.’ But
here it is important to notice the precise limitations under
which Asser uses this last term. It is not coextensive
with the whole of Germanic Britain. It includes Wessex,
Sussex, Kent, Surrey, and Essex. Cornwall is excluded as
being Celtic<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>; but Mercia is also excluded<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, and <i>a fortiori</i>,
though this is not expressly mentioned, East Anglia and
Northumbria<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. In other words it includes that part of
the island which, at the death of Egbert, was under the
direct rule of Wessex; or, to borrow Bede’s useful distinction,
it connotes the ‘regnum’ as opposed to the ‘imperium<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>’
of the West Saxon house. It is possible that in
many cases the term ‘Saxones’ should be understood with
a like limitation, for the Mercii, Northanhymbri, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Orientales Angli are generally mentioned separately. But
I do not think that this limitation can be carried out
quite so rigorously, for instance where Asser speaks of
the ‘Schola Saxonum’ at Rome<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>, answering to the
‘Angelcynnes scolu’ of the Chronicle. In one case he
does expressly distinguish ‘Angli et Saxones<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Alfred
‘king
of the
Anglo-Saxons.’</div>

<p>§ 31. And in this connexion it is deplorable to remark
that for Asser Alfred is always ‘king of the Anglo-Saxons<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>’;
but then we must remember that Asser never
had the advantage of reading Mr. Freeman’s history of
the Norman Conquest, or of attending the lectures of
Professor Napier. But, jesting apart, it is important to
note that by the use of this title our author intends to
mark a real advance in power and dignity on the part of
Alfred as compared with his predecessors, none of whom
bears any higher style than that of king of the West
Saxons<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>, and the change of style is justified by the fact
that a large number of Mercian Angles became Alfred’s
immediate subjects in 878. On the other hand Asser
does not exaggerate Alfred’s position, as later Chroniclers
do, calling him ‘monarch of the whole of Britain’ and so
on<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. If the heading of the work is genuine, as I am
inclined for this very reason to think it is, Alfred is
addressed as ‘ruler of all the Christians of the isle of
Britain<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.’ In other words the writer recognises exactly
the same limitations to Alfred’s power as does the Saxon
Chronicle, where it says that, after Alfred’s occupation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
London, all the English kin submitted to him, except
what was under the thraldom of the Danes<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
Celtic
terms.</div>

<p>Another term of Celtic origin is probably to be found in
the unique title of ‘secundarius’ given by Asser to Alfred
during the reign of Æthelred<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>; but of this I shall have
more to say in another lecture; while for ‘graphium’ in
the sense of ‘donation’ or ‘written grant,’ the only other
authority quoted is from the life of a Welsh saint<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Celtic use
of the
term
<i>Germania</i>.</div>

<p>§ 32. Another trace of Celtic influence is to be found,
I believe, in the innocent-looking passage where it is said
that in 884 an army of pagans from Germany, ‘de
Germania,’ invaded the Old <i>or</i> Continental Saxons<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. It
might be thought that this merely refers to the fact that
part, at any rate, of the invading army had wintered at
Duisburg on the Rhine<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. But could they be said to be
going <i>from</i> Germany when they invaded Saxony? I cannot
speak positively as to all the mediaeval uses of the
word ‘Germania,’ but one would think that it must include
Saxony<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. But however this may be, the fact remains that
Asser nowhere applies the name ‘Germania’ to any part of
the Carolingian empire. The people of that empire are
Franks<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. Charles the Great<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, Charles the Bald<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>, Charles
the Fat<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, Louis the Stammerer<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, Louis, king of Northern
France<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>, are all kings of the Franks. Carloman, king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Aquitaine and Burgundy, is king of the Western Franks<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.
We hear also of the kingdom or region of the Western
Franks<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>. The territory included in the empire as a whole
is called Francia<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>. The eastern kingdom is Francia
Orientalis<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. The western territory is sometimes called
Gallia<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>, and its inhabitants are Gauls<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>, or of Gallic race<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.
Charles the Fat, before he gained the western kingdom, is
king of the Alamanni<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. I believe that Germania here
means Norway, a meaning which, strange as it may seem,
it unquestionably has in the Welsh Annals. Thus at 1036
the Brut y Tywysogion calls Canute king of England,
Denmark, and Germania, while at 1056 the title king of
Germania is given to Harold Hardrada. In other words,
the invaders of Saxony, according to Asser, came from
Norway, and not from Denmark, which he calls Danubium<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
Celtic
characteristics.</div>

<p>Another very obvious characteristic of the writer is his
fondness for giving Welsh equivalents for English names
of places<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.</p>

<p>May I add without offence that I think another Celtic
trait in our author is a certain largeness of statement?
Mons. Henri Martin, a great admirer of the Celts, notes
as characteristic of them a certain ‘rebellion against facts<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>’;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and there are many things in Asser which we can hardly
accept as literally true, though, as I have shown already,
and shall have to show again, some of the criticisms directed
against him rest on misunderstandings of his words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Knowledge
of
South
Welsh
affairs.</div>

<p>§ 33. We have next to consider the author’s knowledge
of South Welsh affairs. The principal passage is the one
already alluded to where Asser describes his motives for
entering Alfred’s service<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>. He and his friends hoped
thereby to check the mischief inflicted on St. David’s by
Hemeid, king of Dyfed, who had on one occasion expelled
Archbishop Novis, Asser’s relative, and himself. Alfred
was in a position to help, for some time previously all the
princes of South Wales had commended themselves to
Alfred; Hemeid himself, and Helised ap Teudyr, king of
Brecheiniog, owing to the pressure of the sons of Rotri
Mawr, king of North Wales; while Howel ap Rhys, king
of Glewissig, Brochmail and Fernmail, sons of Mouric,
kings of Gwent, took the same step, owing to the pressure
of Æthelred of Mercia. Even Anaraut, son of Rotri himself,
with his brothers, leaving the friendship of the
Northumbrians (by which I take the Northumbrian Danes
to be meant) sought the king’s friendship; and after being
honourably received by him, and made his godson at confirmation,
agreed to stand to him in the same relation of
subordination as Æthelred did in Mercia, and was dismissed
with rich presents—a scene which almost repeats the submission
of Guthrum, and incidentally perhaps supports the
view that the defect of which Augustine complained in
Welsh baptismal practice, was the omission of the rite of
confirmation<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>; while the comparison with Æthelred of
Mercia illustrates the semi-royal position of Alfred’s son-in-law<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
at least as forcibly as it illustrates Anaraut’s
dependence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Relations
of Wales
to Wessex.</div>

<p>§ 34. Many years ago the late Mr. Bradshaw laid stress
on the forms of these Welsh names as showing that Asser
could not be a late forgery<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. This argument becomes of
less importance in view of the results we have already
arrived at as to the date, and of the fact that names of the
same type occur in documents later than the latest date
which any reasonable critic could propose for Asser<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. But
the whole passage throws a flood of light on the state of
Wales, and its relations to the house of Wessex. We see
South Wales forced to submit to Wessex by the joint
pressure of North Wales and Mercia; while North Wales,
which had remained hostile at any rate up to 880, when
a battle was fought which was regarded as avenging the
slaughter of Rotri Mawr by the Saxons in 877<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, ultimately
found it to its interest to seek the shelter of the West
Saxon overlord. Thus we see actually going on before
our eyes the transition from the state of things under
Egbert, when the Celtic population joined eagerly with the
Scandinavian invaders in the hope of undoing the work of
the Saxon Conquest<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>, to a state of things in which they
combine with their Saxon rivals against the common foe.
It seems to me that such a passage, introduced so incidentally
and naturally, could only have been written by a
contemporary writer. Moreover all the South Welsh
princes, with two exceptions, are mentioned in the Book of
Llandaff, several of them occur in the Annals. Hemeid of
Dyfed, Asser’s enemy, died in 892 or 891<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. Howel ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Rhys is probably the Howel who died at Rome in 885<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
whither he had gone, it is not unlikely, in expiation of the
crime—a peculiarly foul case of treachery—recited in the
Book of Llandaff<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. His district, Glewissig, is often mentioned
in the same authority; it is ‘roughly the district
between the lower courses of the Usk and Towy<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.’ Mouric
of Gwent and his sons Brochmail and Fernmail also occur
frequently<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. Mouric is probably the one whose death is
recorded in 873<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. The only prince as to whom I can find
nothing is Helised ap Teudyr of Brecheiniog. But there
is a Teudyr ab Elised, king of Brecheiniog<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>, contemporary
with Llunwerth or Llwmbert, the successor of Novis in the
see of St. David’s, who is not impossibly his father. Of
Novis himself I have said enough above (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Events of
878.</div>

<p>Another place where the author shows his knowledge of
South Welsh affairs is in the interesting addition which he
makes to the Chronicle under 878, to the effect that the
heathen force which besieged Cynwit on the north coast
of Devon, had wintered in Dyfed, and massacred many
Christians there<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. Facts like this explain the change of
attitude on the part of the Welsh. South Wales also
suffered severely in 895<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
as to
unity of
authorship. Peculiar
sense of
the word
<i>aedificia</i>.</div>

<p>§ 35. I have so far spoken of ‘our author’ in the
singular. But the question must now be faced: is the
work (apart from actual and possible interpolations) the
composition of a single hand? When I first took up this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
question I rather hoped that the result to be arrived at
would be, that the annals were the work of one author,
the biographical notes of another, while the florid head-links,
of which I spoke before<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>, would be the work of the later
editor who combined the two documents. This would have
been a result dear to the heart of the higher critic. But
any such theory, however pretty, will not stand a moment’s
examination. Allowing for the difference of subject-matter,
the same characteristics appear both in the annalistic and
biographical sections. Thus of five instances of the Celtic
use of left and right instead of north and south, two occur
in the annals and three in the biography; ‘Britannia,’ in
the sense of ‘Wales,’ occurs six times in the biography and
once in the annals<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. So there are some not quite common
words and expressions, for which the writer has an evident
predilection, which are sprinkled about both parts of the
work. The details are too dry for reproduction here, and
may be safely relegated to the obscurity of a footnote<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
But one instance is of sufficient general interest to merit
discussion. This is the use of the word ‘aedificia’ in the
sense of articles of goldsmiths’ work. To this I can produce
no parallel from any other writer; but the meaning
seems to me practically certain in three instances, and
probable in the fourth; and of these four cases one occurs
in the annals, and the rest in the biography. The first
instance is where Alfred, after Guthrum’s baptism, gives
him ‘multa et optima aedificia<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.’ It is clear that Guthrum
did not carry away with him edifices, in the ordinary sense
of the word. Lappenberg would alter ‘aedificia’ into
‘beneficia<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>’; ‘mit vollem Rechte,’ says Pauli<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>; but this
will hardly do in other cases, as we shall see.</p>

<p>The next instance is where Asser says that Alfred ‘by
his novel contrivance made “aedificia” more venerable and
precious than any of his predecessors<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.’ Here the ordinary
meaning is just possible, though the epithet ‘pretiosiora’
and the fact that ‘aurifices et artifices’ are mentioned just
before, point decidedly the other way. The third passage
speaks of ‘aedificia of gold and silver incomparably wrought
under his instructions<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.’ Even the most Celtic imagination
cannot suppose that Alfred built edifices, in the ordinary
sense, of the precious metals, especially as his own royal
halls and chambers are expressly stated to have been of
stone and wood<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. The fourth passage tells how Alfred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
had workmen who were skilled ‘in omni terreno aedificio<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>,’
where the meaning is probably the same. The use of the
word in so strange a sense in both parts of the work seems
to me a strong proof of unity of authorship. The usage,
however, becomes a little less strange if we remember how
much of the goldsmith’s art at that time would go to the
making of shrines and reliquaries, which really were
‘edifices’ in miniature. The two middle passages which
speak of Alfred’s ‘novel contrivance,’ and of his personal
instructions to his workmen, are of singular interest in
connexion with the Alfred Jewel; and the fact that my
friend Professor Earle, who has made a special study of
that jewel, agrees with my interpretation of these passages,
adds greatly to my confidence in advancing it. Alfred’s
love for this kind of art seems to have been hereditary.
William of Malmesbury gives an account of a shrine which
Æthelwulf had made to contain the bones of St. Aldhelm.
‘The covering is of crystal, whereon the king’s name may
be read in letters of gold<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.’ This exactly answers to the
character of the Alfred Jewel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asser’s
style.</div>

<p>§ 36. Of Asser’s style two prominent characteristics are
a fondness for long parentheses<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>, and a tiresome trick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
repeating a word or phrase, sometimes with a slight variation,
at intervals, in some cases longer, in others very
short<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. He certainly would have had no chance with the
editor who objected to the quotation ‘to the pure all things
are pure,’ on the ground that it sinned against the rule of
the office that the same word must not be repeated within
six lines. Occasionally he seems as if he could not get
away from a phrase, but clings to it, as a drowning man
clings to a plank; and I think that this feature is due, not
to any love for these particular words and phrases, but to
a poverty of expression like that which causes the repetitions
of an unpractised speaker. These characteristics
come out most strongly no doubt in the biographical
sections, but they are not wholly absent from the others<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation of Asser
to the
Saxon
Chronicle. Mistranslation, or misunderstanding.</div>

<p>§ 37. The next question which must be considered is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the relation of the Latin Annals of Asser to the corresponding
passages of the Saxon Chronicle. Sir Henry Howorth
indeed expresses roundly his conviction that Asser wrote (if
indeed he would not rather say forged) the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>. This I regard as quite inconceivable. Sir
James Ramsay, without going so far as this, records that
‘several’ passages have convinced him that the Latin of
Asser is more original than the Saxon of the Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.
Unfortunately he does not indicate these passages. My
own conviction is unfalteringly the other way. In the first
place there is at least one passage in Asser which can only
be explained as a mistranslation of the Chronicle. It
occurs under 876. Here the Chronicle has a phrase which
puzzled all translators of the Chronicle, mediaeval and
modern, till it was cleared up by Professor Earle. It runs
thus: ‘The mounted force (<i>i.e.</i> of the Danes) stole away
from the fyrd and got into Exeter.’ Asser misunderstands
this, making it a defeat of a native body of cavalry by the
Danes<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. At 886<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> there seems also to be a mistranslation
or misunderstanding, but the text is possibly corrupt, and
Florence has not improved it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘East-Seaxum.’</div>

dative plural surely imply a Saxon original. It may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
noted too that Asser retains the Saxon name of the river
Seine, Signe<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>, whereas the more classical Florence translates
it into the Latin form, Sequana. Phrases again like
‘ipso eodem anno<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>’ for ‘þy ilcan geare,’ and the constantly
recurring ‘loco funeris dominati sunt<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>’ for ‘ahton wælstowe
geweald,’ ‘superius’ for ‘ufor<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>’ point the same
way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Omission.</div>

<p>Again, Asser accidentally omits the annal 884, which is
a very brief one in the Chronicle. Consequently, he
mechanically puts the events of 885 under 884.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronology.</div>

<p>Lastly, Steenstrup showed by a comparison of the continental
Chronicles that the movements of the Danes from
879 to 897 in the Saxon Chronicle (= 878-896) are
probably dated a year too late<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. This is confirmed by the
mention of a solar eclipse under 879 at one o’clock of the
day. Now in 878 there was a solar eclipse on October 29,
at 1.30 p.m. There was a solar eclipse also in 879, on
March 26, but this was at 4 p.m. Asser gives the hour of
the eclipse as ‘between nones and vespers but nearer to
nones<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.’ In other words he has altered the hour of the
eclipse given by the Chronicle to suit the wrong numbering
of the Annal. The force of these arguments taken together
seems to me overwhelming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asser’s
additions
to the
Chronicle.</div>

<p>§ 38. But Asser is not content to be a mere translator.
He makes considerable additions to the Chronicle, which
vary very much in value. Some are pure rhetoric, others
are mere inferences from the words of the Chronicle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
legitimate enough it may be, but of no higher authority
than similar inferences deduced by ourselves. Many consist
of interpretations of Saxon names<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>, or statements of
their Welsh equivalents<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>. A considerable number are
geographical glosses explaining the situation of the places
mentioned<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. These three last classes of additions occur
only in the Annals, and all three seem to point to an interpreter
wishing to make his original clearer to his
readers, who are assumed to be unfamiliar with Saxon
names and places. Even the situation of London is carefully
explained. But other additions, like the one discussed
above about the wintering of the Danish fleet in Dyfed<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>,
are of real value, and evidently rest on authentic
information.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abrupt
termination.</div>

<p>§ 39. The abrupt termination of the work after the year
887 has always been a difficulty. If we could trust the
statement that the work was written in Alfred’s forty-fifth
year, i.e. about 894<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, we might account for this by
supposing that the Chronicle, from which the writer borrows
so much, had not at that time got much beyond 887.
And the work may have been laid aside and never taken up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
again. Unfortunately this date occurs in one of those
suspicious passages about Alfred’s illness, though not in
the one most open to suspicion. Or, again, the work
may be mutilated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asser to
be used
with
caution; but there
is a
genuine
nucleus.</div>

<p>§ 40. On the whole, then, Asser is an authority to be
used with criticism and caution; partly because we have
always to be alive to the possibility of interpolation, partly
because the writer’s Celtic imagination is apt to run away
with him. But that there is a nucleus which is the genuine
work of a single writer, a South Walian contemporary of
Alfred, I feel tolerably sure, and I know no reason why
that South Walian contemporary should not be Asser of
Menevia. There is a slight confirmation of this view in
the quotation which the writer makes from Gregory’s
Cura Pastoralis<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, for we know from Alfred’s own mouth that
Asser was one of those who helped him in the translation
of that work. Another coincidence with Alfred’s preface to
the Cura Pastoralis is to be found in the phrase ‘aliquando
sensum ex sensu ponens,’ which Asser uses in reference to
the translation of Gregory’s Dialogues<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. Anyhow, as
I have shown<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, the work which bears Asser’s name cannot
be later than 974, and the attempt to treat it as a forgery
of the eleventh or twelfth century must be regarded as
having broken down. I may add that I started with
a strong prejudice against the authenticity of Asser, so
that my conclusions have at any rate been impartially
arrived at.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A puzzling
work.</div>

<p>§ 41. Still the book remains a puzzle both in form and
substance. It was a curious work to offer to Alfred if it
contained the scandals about Æthelbald and Judith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
what we must regard as the idealised description of Alfred’s
court and administration. I am conscious that I am very
far from having solved the problem. I shall be content if
I am thought to have contributed something towards a
solution, which will perhaps be given before long by
Mr. Stevenson. The suggestion of Mr. Macfadyen that
the work was drawn up with a view to Alfred’s canonisation<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
may be dismissed at once. People are not canonised
in their lifetime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lives of
saints.</div>

<p>§ 42. In one class of historical literature, which often
very usefully supplements more formal histories, the reign
of Alfred is singularly barren, I mean the lives of saints.
We have nothing like the lives of Dunstan, Oswald, and
Æthelwold, which give us so much help towards the end
of the next century; or like the lives of Wilfrid and
Cuthbert at an earlier period. The times, indeed, were not
favourable to the development of saintship of the mediaeval
pattern. The monasteries, the chief schools of that type of
sanctity, suffered more than any other institutions at the
hands of the Danes; and the virtues which the age
required were of a more active kind than those which went
to make up the mediaeval ideal. The title of saint is
indeed given by one authority to Werferth, bishop of
Worcester; but this rests, as we shall see, on a misconception;
though in truth, as Mr. Taylor has remarked, the
conduct of Werferth in accepting the see of Worcester in
872, the very year preceding the expulsion of Burgred,
king of Mercia, Alfred’s brother-in-law, by the Danes,
was as heroic as that of any Christian missionary<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lives of
St. Neot;

mythical
character.</div>

<p>§ 43. The only hagiological literature relating to Alfred’s
reign consists of the lives of St. Neot. And these are
late, and not merely unhistorical, but anti-historical. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
them are due some of the prevalent misconceptions as to
Alfred’s reign. For this very reason something must be
said about them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Five
Lives. The
Bodleian
Life. The Bollandist
Life. The
Metrical
Life. The
Anglo-Saxon
Life.</div>

<p>The existing Lives of St. Neot are, as far as I know, five
in number, four in Latin, of which three are in prose and
one in verse, and one Anglo-Saxon Life. Besides these
there is, as we have seen, a fragment of another Latin Life,
embodied in the Annals of St. Neot, and thence transferred
by Archbishop Parker to the text of Asser<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. Roger of
Wendover’s account of St. Neot<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> seems also to be based
on some Life different from any of those mentioned above.
Of the Latin Lives that have come down to us the earliest
is that contained in MS. Bodley 379, and printed at the
end of Whitaker’s Life of St. Neot<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. It may sufficiently
characterise this writer’s style to say that he describes
Wessex as the country of ‘the Anglican Saxons who dwell
beneath the Zephyr wind<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.’ The next Latin Life is that
printed by the Bollandists<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> from a MS. formerly belonging
to Bec. It bears within itself clear evidence of being later
than the Norman Conquest<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. This is a very pedantic
writer. He talks much of form and matter, genus and
species<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>, ‘the dry notions of Logicians,’ as one translator
of Thomas à Kempis<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> depreciatingly calls them; and is
fond of using Greek words like ‘anatole,’ ‘mesembria,’
‘dysis<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.’ The Metrical Life, printed by Whitaker<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> from
a MS. belonging to Magdalen College, Oxford, is clearly
based on this, of which also John of Tynemouth’s Life<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
is a mere abridgement. The Anglo-Saxon Life (or rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Homily) is preserved in a Cottonian MS. (Vesp. D. xiv),
whence it was printed by the Rev. G. C. Gorham in his
History and Antiquities of Eynesbury and St. Neot’s
(1824)<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, and more recently by Cockayne<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and Wülker<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.
As to its date widely different views have been held, based
on divergent interpretations of a passage near the end,
where the writer contrasts the evils of his own times with
the prosperity of Alfred’s later years. Sir T. Duffus Hardy
thought that this description pointed to the year 986 as the
date of composition<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>, while Professor Earle would place it
in the eleventh or twelfth century<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>. But the mistake of
the writer in making Neot contemporary with Ælfheah of
Canterbury is absolutely conclusive against the earlier
date<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>. Wülker is inclined to attribute it to Ælfric<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>;
but this also is unlikely. It is clearly based on earlier
Lives, for the expressions occur: ‘as books say,’ ‘it is
told in writings,’ &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> But I do not think it is directly
derived from any of the preceding Lives, and, though not
ancient, it may be earlier than any of them. It certainly
contains one miracle which is not found in any of the
others, a very quaint story (probably a folk-tale) of a fox
which stole the Saint’s shoe while he was bathing<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analysis
of the
Lives.</div>

<p>§ 44. These lives cover much the same ground. St. Neot
is made the son of Æthelwulf and his wife, granted to
their prayers as a reward for their piety<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. Æthelwulf is
represented not incorrectly as king of one of the four
English kingdoms, viz. of Wessex with Kent<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
three of course being Mercia, East Anglia, and Northumbria.
Of the relations of these kingdoms a very ideal sketch is
given. As the Metrical Life says, in verses which are as
open to criticism on prosodical as they are on historical
grounds:—</p>

<p class="noindent">Neot becomes a monk at Glastonbury under Dunstan<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
(who was made abbot of Glastonbury in 946!), and was
the special friend of Æthelwold<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> (bishop of Winchester

becomes an anchorite in Cornwall, whence he goes to Rome
to Pope Marinus<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>. On his return he founds a monastery
in Cornwall<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, and now it is that Alfred first hears of him
(though according to the pedigree he would be his own
brother). Alfred visits him, and Neot rebukes him for his
licentiousness and tyranny<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, compelling him, in the words
of the Bollandist Life, ‘to tremble at the sulphureous
flames of Gehenna’; he prophesies Alfred’s expulsion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
from the throne, and his ultimate restoration, and then
dies<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. Next comes the invasion of Guthrum. Alfred
gives up everything and flies to Athelney; the cakes are
duly burnt<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>, and then St. Neot appears in a vision and
finally leads the English hosts to victory at Ethandun<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absurdity
of the
story.</div>

<p>§ 45. It would not be necessary to quote this precious
stuff, even in outline, were it not that people still continue
to treat it as more or less historical. I have already adverted
to the strange inconsistency of making Alfred first hear
of Neot’s fame after the latter’s return from Rome, although
he was his own brother according to the pedigree. This
seems to show that the making Neot a son of Æthelwulf
was a later development, and not part of the original legend.
And, indeed, in the fragment of the Life interpolated in
Asser he is no more than Alfred’s ‘cognatus<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>,’ which in
mediaeval Latin means cousin, or sometimes brother-in-law,
like ‘cognato’ in modern Italian<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. But if St. Neot
ever existed, his connexion with the royal house of Wessex
has probably as little basis in fact, as the forged Carolingian
pedigree which the later Lives of St. Hubert give to that
Saint<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>. Another noteworthy point is that the only pope
contemporary with Alfred known to these Lives is Marinus<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>,
though his obscure pontificate only lasted a little over
a year (December, 882, to the beginning of 884<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>), and was
some time posterior to the death of Neot, who is represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as dying before the campaign of 878<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>. The reason for
this prominence is, of course, to be found in the privileges
which this pope was said to have granted, at Alfred’s
request, to the English School at Rome<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, and still more in
the story that he had sent a fragment of the true cross to
Alfred<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>. I need hardly say that the idea of Alfred’s early
licentiousness, or of his tyranny at the beginning of his
reign, is absolutely inconsistent with authentic history.
The year 871, when Wessex was at deathgrips with the
foe, was not the time, even if Alfred had been the man,
for establishing a tyranny. It is pitiable that modern
writers should lend even half an ear<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> to these wretched
tales, which besmirch the fair fame of our hero king, in
order to exalt a phantom saint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
withdrawal
to
Athelney.</div>

<p>§ 46. But perhaps the worst misconception, and the one
which has most injuriously affected English history, is that
connected with the withdrawal to Athelney. The Lives
represent Alfred on the invasion of Guthrum as becoming
not merely a helpless, but a cowardly and criminal fugitive.
This view is put most strongly in the Saxon Life, which
runs as follows<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>: ‘Then came Guthrum the heathen king
with his cruel host first to the eastern part of Saxland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
(Saxonia).… When King Alfred … learnt that the host …
was … so near England, he straightway for fear took to
flight, and forsook all his warriors and his captains and all
his people, … and crept by hedge and lane, through wood
and field, till he … came to Athelney,’ where the cakes
are burnt. Now there is no doubt that Wessex was
thoroughly surprised by the sudden attack of the Danes at
mid-winter, after twelfth-night, 878<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. And it is possible
that in this the Danes were hardly ‘playing the game.’
Military operations were generally suspended in the winter.
Chippenham was a ‘villa regia’ as Asser notes; and it
looks as if the Danes, with Boer ‘slimness,’ had tried to
surprise Alfred in his winter home<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. Happily they failed
in this, and, as Pauli has finely said<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>, Alfred’s cause was
not hopeless as long as Alfred was alive. For the moment
the struggle was converted into a guerilla war. But this
is what authentic history has to say about it: ‘Here the
host … stole on Chippenham and surprised Wessex, …
and most of the people they reduced except the King
Alfred<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, and he with a little band made his way with
difficulty by wood and swamp; … and then after Easter
he with his little band made a fort at Athelney, and from
that fort kept fighting against the foe<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>,’ until he in his turn
surprised the Danes, and forced them to submit. Athelney,
in fact, played no small part in the redemption of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
Chroniclers;
Ethelwerd.</div>

<p>§ 47. Of later Chroniclers, Ethelwerd, at the end of the
next century, bases his work mainly on the Chronicle.
But, like Asser, he has good additions here and there; and
as he was closely connected with the royal house of Wessex,
being descended from Æthelred, Alfred’s brother, and was
also highly placed as an ealdorman in Wessex, he may well
have had access to authentic sources of information. Unfortunately
there is no one who has worked at Ethelwerd,
who will not echo Ranke’s sigh: ‘wenn er nur verständlich
wäre<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>!’ ‘If only he were intelligible!’ The designation
which he gives to himself: ‘Patricius consul Fabius
Quaestor Ethelwerdus’ is but too true an index of the
puerile pomposity of his style. Something of this unintelligibility
is no doubt to be put down to the corruption
of the text<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>, of which no MS. is known to exist. But if
he fails to make us understand his Latin, his blunders in
translating the Chronicle show that he had a very imperfect
acquaintance with the Saxon language<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. It is possible
that this fact may be due, as Professor York Powell once
suggested to me, to his having been brought up on the
Continent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Florence

<p>The careful Florence gives us less help than usual in

from Asser. His splendid and inspiring panegyric on
Alfred<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> is almost his only serious addition, though a worthy
one, to what we learn from Asser and the Chronicle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry of

<p>Henry of Huntingdon makes no use of Asser, and does
little more than reproduce the Chronicle. There is no
trace of the use of ancient ballads<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>, such as we find in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
other parts of his history; no survival of personal traditions,
like the splendid anecdotes of old Siward a century
and a half later, one of which is the ultimate source of
Shakespeare’s glorious lines:—</p>

<p>§ 48. Of the double recension of the annals of this reign
in Simeon of Durham I have spoken above. In the second
one, which is Simeon’s own, there is very little which is
not derived from Florence, Asser, and the Chronicle, except
a few notices of northern affairs, taken mainly from his
own history of the Church of Durham. The earlier recension
also adds little to our authorities, except the writer’s
own rhetoric, of which the following specimen from the
opening of the battle of Ethandun may suffice<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>:—‘When
the most limpid ray of the sun arose, the king and all the
glory of his people put on their warlike adornments, that is
to say, the threefold breastplate of faith, hope, and love of
God. They, rising from the ground, boldly challenged
the caitifs<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> to the fight, trusting in the clemency of the
Creator, secure and fortified as with a rampart by the
presence of their king, whose countenance shone like that
of a resplendent angel,’ with more to the same purpose—or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
want of purpose. In these northern accounts St. Cuthbert
plays very much the part which St. Neot plays in
southern legend, appearing to Alfred in his distress, and
promising him victory<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>, a trait adopted also by William of
Malmesbury<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. And with this stream of legend Mr. Freeman<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
ingeniously connects the dedication of the parish
church<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> of Wells to St. Cuthbert, a very unusual dedication
for a south-country church. Moreover, some of these
northern accounts prolong the retreat of Alfred in the
marshes of Somerset from three months to three years<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>.
We are fast entering the world of legend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William
of Malmesbury.</div>

<p>William of Malmesbury uses both Asser and the
Chronicle, though he declines ‘to unravel separately the
inextricable labyrinths of Alfred’s labours.’ He adds not
only the legend of St. Cuthbert, but also the stories of the
golden bracelets, and of Alfred visiting the Danish camp
disguised as a minstrel<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>; wandering folk-tales which get
attached to more than one historical character. There is
no reason to believe that Malmesbury had for Alfred’s
reign any historical authority not open to ourselves, as he
unquestionably had for that of Athelstan; unless, indeed,
he had seen Alfred’s Handbook, of which I shall have more
to say later on<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>. He has, however, some very interesting
remarks on Alfred’s literary works<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
some
of the
myths.</div>

<p>§ 50. In some cases we can trace how the later myth
arose; and this furnishes us with an instructive warning
as to the danger of listening to the unsupported statements
of later chroniclers, as many modern writers are half
inclined to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Simeon of
Durham.</div>

<p>The following is a good instance:—</p>

<p>The Chronicle under 885 tells how Alfred sent a fleet to
East Anglia, which defeated a force of sixteen wiking
ships at the mouth of the Stour, but on their way home
fell in with a superior force of the enemy, and were totally
defeated. In the earlier text of Simeon of Durham an
elaborate explanation is given of the cause of this defeat<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>;
how the English were surprised, an unarmed multitude,
when plunged in lazy sleep; so that to them, says the
moralising writer, would apply the proverb: ‘many shut
their eyes when they ought to see.’ Will it be believed
that this elaborate tale, with its attendant moral, has all
grown out of a false reading in the parallel account of
Asser? He says that the English were attacked ‘cum
inde uictrix classis dormiret,’ where ‘dormiret’ is a corruption
of ‘domum iret,’ the ‘hamweard wendon’ of the
Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>. Florence has ‘rediret,’ whether that be his
substitution for ‘domum iret,’ or his own correction of the
obviously nonsensical ‘dormiret.’ This example is further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
interesting as showing how early the text of Asser was
corrupted. Simeon in his turn is misunderstood by later
writers. The Chronicle of Melrose says<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> that in 883
Alfred ‘began to inhabit the devastated provinces of
Northumbria.’ This is a misreading of a passage in
Simeon<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>, in which the nominative to ‘prepared to inhabit’
is ‘exercitus,’ i.e. the Danish army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Langtoft.</div>

<p>Langtoft says that Æthelred died at Driffield, which
shows that he first of all confused him with Aldfrid of
Northumbria<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>, who reigned just two hundred years
earlier; he next goes on to confuse him with his own
brother Alfred<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. As he writes Æthelred’s name ‘Elfred’
the confusion of names is not surprising. We are reminded
of Fuller’s quaint protest against the similar confusion in
the case of Ceadda (Chad) and Cedd: ‘though it is pleasant
for brethren to live together in unity, yet it is not fit by
errour that they should be jumbled together in confusion<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roger of
Wendover.</div>

<p>Roger of Wendover says that Alfred sent alms to
Jerusalem<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>. The thing in itself is not impossible. But the
context in which the statement occurs shows that it rests
simply on a false reading in two MSS. of the Saxon
Chronicle ‘Iudea’ for ‘Indea<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liber de
Hyda.</div>

<p>Lastly the Liber de Hyda gives Alfred a pedigree which
seems to make him a descendant of Offa of Mercia<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. If
this pedigree was the only one which we possessed, we
might rack our brains to discover what the connexion was.
But on reference to the authorised West-Saxon pedigree we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
find that the compiler of the Liber de Hyda has simply
made a confusion between Offa of Mercia and Eafa, one of
the steps in the descent of the royal house of Wessex.</p>

<p>One wonders how many statements, usually accepted as
historical, would, if they could be traced to their origin,
prove to have no better foundation than these.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ingulf.</div>

<p>§ 51. Curiously enough, among the statements of later
writers, some of those which sound most authentic occur in
Ingulf, one of the most notable forgeries of the Middle
Ages<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>. It seems to me that the accounts of the ravages
of the Danes<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> may rest, at least in their outlines, on
genuine local traditions. Other statements, though probably
false considered as descriptions of concrete facts, may
be true as types of things which must almost certainly
have occurred. For instance, when we are told<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> that
a monk of Croyland named Tolius, formerly a Mercian
soldier of repute, organised military resistance to the Danes,
I take the freedom very seriously to doubt the historical
existence of any person of that name. But that in the
time of their country’s need, more than one world-weary
warrior may have come forth from their monastic retreats,
to lead their countrymen against the foe, just as two
centuries earlier Sigbert, ex-king of the East Angles, had
been dragged from the cloister to lead his former subjects
against the heathen Penda<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>, is more than likely. So when
we read how Beornred, king of Mercia, took advantage of
the confusion caused by the Danish raids to annex monastic
estates<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>, how, owing to the ravages of the Danes, and the
exactions of their puppet king, Ceolwulf, Croyland became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
so poor that no one could be found to take the monastic
vows there<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>, we have every disposition to accept the
statements.</p>

<p>It is in Ingulf that Alfred is praised for his devotion to
St. Neot and <i>St.</i> Werferth<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. It is curious to find the very
definite connexion of Alfred with the human friend who
helped him so much in his literary and other tasks, converted
into the shadowy relation of a votary to a saint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘A land
where all

Alfred’s
fame.</div>

<p>§ 52. Where, on the other hand, this growth of legend
does not appear in later chroniclers, we seem to come into
‘a land where all things are forgotten.’ And it is, I think,
unquestionably true, that Alfred’s fame was in after times
largely obscured by that of Edgar. The connexion of the
latter with the monastic revival secured him the homage of
monastic historians, and his imperial position appealed
more to the imagination of posterity than the weightier
achievements of Alfred. And then he was three-quarters
of a century nearer to their view. It is not unnatural
therefore that the laws and homilies of Æthelred’s reign
should look back to the reign of Edgar as a golden age<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>;
that here in Oxford, in 1018, Canute and his conquered
subjects should be reconciled on the basis of Edgar’s law<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.
The one exception is the Anglo-Saxon homily on St. Neot,
in which the later years of Alfred are regarded as the
golden age<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. The motive of this is too obvious to be
dwelt on. But to show how small a space Alfred occupies
in some of the later Chronicles, I may point out that in
the Annals of Waverley<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> the only thing mentioned about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
him is his foundation of the three monasteries of Athelney,
Newminster, and Shaftesbury, that in the Annals of
Dunstaple<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> the only act recorded of him is the sending of
alms to St. Thomas in India; while this is what his reign
shrinks to in the pages of Capgrave, the first to apply the
English tongue once more to the original writing of history
in prose:—</p>

<p>‘In this tyme regned Alured in Ynglond, the fourt son
of Adelwold. He began to regn in the ȝere of our Lord
872. This man, be the councelle of St. Ned, mad an open
Scole of divers sciens at Oxenford. He had many batailes
with Danes; and aftir many conflictes in which he had the

<div class="sidenote">Date of
Alfred’s
birth.</div>

<p>§ 53. There has been a good deal of discussion as to
the date of Alfred’s birth. Asser at the beginning of his
work places it in 849. And in the annalistic portions he
dates each year, not only by the Incarnation, but by the
nativity of Alfred. From 851 to 869 inclusive this latter
series (with one exception) is correctly reckoned from
Asser’s own date 849; from 870 to 876 the dates are
reckoned as if from 850; from 878 to 887 they are
reckoned as if from 852. In one case, the annal for 853,
the resulting year of Alfred’s nativity is 843. With this
single exception all the other errors are accounted for by
the accidental repetition of numbers, combined with the
occurrence of blank annals which are not allowed for<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.
I have shown elsewhere how the chronology of the Saxon
Chronicle is dislocated in various places by similar causes
of a purely mechanical nature<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>. It is idle to build anything
on this. Sir James Ramsay indeed seizes on the
one eccentric annal 853 as giving the true date of Alfred’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
birth<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>. But, to say the least, the doctrine of chances is
strongly against this. We cannot indeed account for this
date by progressive degeneration, but it is simply one of
those scribal errors to which numerals are peculiarly liable<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true
date is
848.</div>

<p>The best authority for the date of Alfred’s birth has
been generally overlooked. This is the genealogical preface
prefixed to MS. <img class="inline" src="images/a.jpg" width="20" height="20" alt="A" /> of the Chronicle. This is a strictly
contemporary document, being drawn up during Alfred’s
reign, as is proved by the fact that, though it gives
Alfred’s accession, it does not, as in the case of all preceding
kings, give the length of his reign. According to
this authority Alfred ‘took to the kingdom when there
were gone of his age three and twenty winters.’ In other
words, Alfred was ‘turned’ twenty-three, as we say, at his
accession in 871. This fixes his birth to 848<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>. The place,
according to Asser, was Wantage.</p>

<p>§ 54. The earliest event recorded in the life of Alfred is
his being sent to Rome in 853, when he would be, according
to this, five years old. Of the fact there can be no
possible doubt. It is not only mentioned by the Chronicle
and Asser; but we have the actual letter which Leo IV
wrote to Æthelwulf announcing Alfred’s safe arrival<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.
Considering the child’s tender age, I can hardly think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that the object of the journey was educational, as is
very commonly supposed; to say nothing of the fact that
Rome, at this time, had very little to offer in the way of
education, being far outstripped in this respect by the
Carolingian schools of Germany and Gaul<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. The motive
was, I think, much more religious than intellectual. I see
no reason to doubt Asser’s statement that Alfred was, from
the very first, a child of singular promise and attractiveness<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>;
and his parents, who were both conspicuous for
their piety<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>, may well have wished to secure for their
favourite child<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>, in his earliest years, those spiritual advantages
which were believed to attend a pilgrimage to Rome,
and contact with the visible head of the Church. The
passion for pilgrimages and relics was indeed at its height
in the ninth century<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. So far there is no difficulty. The
difficulty is as to what took place at Rome. Not only
Asser, but the Chronicle, assert that the pope ‘hallowed
Alfred as king, and took him as his bishop’s son.’ The
latter phrase clearly points to confirmation. We have seen
by the case of Anaraut of North Wales, that it was no
unusual compliment for one exalted person to act as sponsor
to another at his confirmation<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>, or, as in the case of
Guthrum, at his baptism. And in some cases the confirming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
or baptising prelate acted also as sponsor, as we see in the
case of Birinus and Cuthred of Wessex, mentioned in the
Chronicle at 639. There is therefore some plausibility in
the suggestion, that the unction which formed part of the
rite of confirmation was afterwards misinterpreted as a
royal anointing. This theory was put forward as early as
the seventeenth century, as appears by Sir John Spelman’s
life of Alfred<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>, and has been accepted by many subsequent
writers, myself included. I confess it fails to satisfy me
now. The statement of the Chronicle seems to me too
explicit to be lightly set aside. Dr. Liebermann indeed
argues<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> that the Chronicle cannot have been drawn up
under Alfred’s influence, because of the gross improbability
of this very statement. I am inclined to turn the argument
round the other way. I think that Alfred must have
understood the ceremony to mean something more than
confirmation, especially as the two ceremonies, the hallowing
as king, and the reception as ‘bishop’s son,’ are in
the Chronicle clearly distinguished. In the letter of
Leo IV alluded to above the words run thus: ‘We have
affectionately received your son Erfred … and have invested
him as a spiritual son with the girdle (or office),
insignia, and robes<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> of the consulate, as is the manner of
Roman consuls.’ It is certain that Clovis wore a diadem
after receiving the consular insignia from Constantinople<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>;
and in these ceremonial matters the Papacy largely inherited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the traditions of the Byzantine Court. If then the imposition
of a diadem of some kind on the child’s head
formed part of the ceremony of the consular investiture,
this would come very near to a royal coronation. I am
however inclined to go a step further in the way of
suggestion. Ailred of Rievaulx indeed, who compares the
anointing of David by Samuel, supposes the pope to have
been endowed with the gift of prophecy<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. And a spurious
charter<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> represents Alfred as making promises to the pope,
as if it was then certain that he would one day become
king. But, humanly speaking, it was of course impossible
that Alfred’s succession to the West Saxon throne should
have been foreseen in 853, seeing that he had three brothers
living, all older than himself. But is it not possible that
he may titularly have held some subordinate royalty conferred
on him by his father for this very object? Athelstan,
the under-king of Kent, disappears from history after
851. Æthelberht, Alfred’s second brother, was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to that under-kingdom when Æthelwulf went to Rome in
855<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>. Is it not just possible that in the interval it may
have been titularly conferred on Alfred? What emboldens
me to make this suggestion is the curiously interesting
parallel of Louis the Pious, who, at the age of three, was
crowned by Pope Hadrian I in 781 as king of Aquitaine<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>.
But if this be thought too bold a theory, then I should
fall back on the diadem as one of the consular insignia.
When in the course of years Alfred inherited his father’s
throne, he, and others, may well have seen in the action of
him who was ‘high priest that same year,’ a prophetic
significance; just as St. John traces a higher inspiration
in words<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>, which, in the intention of the speaker, simply
laid down the doctrine of political expediency in its most
brutal form.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Æthelwulf’s
visit to
Rome.</div>

<p>§ 55. Two years later, in 855, Æthelwulf went to Rome
himself<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. As early as the year of his accession, 839, he
had formed the plan, and had sent an embassy to the
emperor, Louis the Pious, to prepare the way<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>; and now
at last, after sixteen years, he was able to accomplish it.
How much the subject filled his thoughts seems to be
indicated by the fact that a charter of this year is dated:
‘when I set out to go beyond the sea to Rome<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.’ He
hardly left ‘composito regno’ as William of Malmesbury
states<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>, for in 855 the Danes for the second time wintered
in the island<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>, and a Mercian charter of this very year is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
dated: ‘when the Pagans were in the country of the
Wrekin<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>’; though that concerned Mercia more immediately
than Wessex. Before leaving England Æthelwulf
entrusted his dominions to his two eldest sons in the way
in which they were ultimately divided at his death;
Æthelbald receiving Wessex, and Æthelberht Kent with
its dependencies<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. The spirit of family partitions, which
wrecked the Carolingian empire, threatened the house of
Wessex also. Happily the evil consequences were averted,
as we shall see<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>, by the patriotic unselfishness of the two
youngest brothers, Æthelred and Alfred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He takes
Alfred
with him. Æthelwulf’s
reception

Continent.</div>

<p>Æthelwulf took Alfred with him on this journey to
Rome. This fact is not mentioned in the Chronicle, and
rests only on the authority of Asser<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>, and those writers
who have copied him. But on the whole the statements
are too precise to be set aside, and we may accept
Dr. Stubbs’ decision: ‘there is no possibility that a single
visit has been broken into two<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.’ That the child returned
to England after his visit in 853, and did not wait at Rome
till his father came, is proved by the fact that his signature
is affixed to the charter of 855, already cited, which Æthelwulf
executed when setting out for Rome<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>: and this is
better authority than that of the two recensions of
Simeon of Durham; which however both state the fact
very distinctly<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.</p>

<p>The continental authorities do not mention Alfred; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
they tell how honourably the emperor Charles the Bald
received Æthelwulf, and escorted him to the borders of his
kingdom<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>; while the Roman historian gives lists of the
offerings which the pious monarch made at the holy places<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>.
Gregorovius indeed says that he came ‘to be anointed and
crowned by the pope<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.’ But he gives no authority, and
I do not believe that any exists. Some authorities transfer
to this visit the royal unction of Alfred<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>, while another
places it at Æthelwulf’s death, January, 858<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. But there
is no reason to believe that Alfred remained at Rome after
his father left. The object of both versions is to make the
story of the unction rather more probable; but both alike
are inconsistent with the fact that Leo IV, who is always
represented as the anointing pontiff, died July 17, 855<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of
Rome at
this time. The
Saracens.</div>

<p>§ 56. According to the Chronicle and Asser, Æthelwulf
remained a year in Rome, and according to William of
Malmesbury he restored the ‘Schola Saxonum<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>’ or English
hostelry there, which is probable enough, as early in Leo’s
reign it had suffered much from fire<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. It is worth while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to take a glance at the state of Rome at this time. Only
nine years before, under Sergius II, a Saracen fleet had
entered the Tiber and sacked the papal suburb, though they
probably did not capture Rome itself. St. Peter’s, the
centre of Western Christendom, the archive, the museum,
the treasury of five centuries of Christian devotion, became
their prey. The church of his brother apostle St. Paul,
scarcely less rich, shared a like fate<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. The conquest of
Sicily, 827-832, had thrown down the last barrier against
Islam<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. The Mediterranean was indeed fast becoming a
Saracenic lake; and the Saracens were, as has been well
said<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>, to the dwellers on its coasts very much what the
Danes and Northmen were to the dwellers on the coasts
of Northern Europe, a haunting ever-present dread, which
would not let men sleep. Some parts indeed suffered from
both plagues alike<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>; and in Spain we find Saracen and
Christian combining against the Dane<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>, much as we have
seen Celt and Saxon combining in England<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>. It was to
prevent a repetition of the disaster of 846 that Leo IV,
with the help of the emperor Lothair<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>, built the fortifications
which have ever since given to the papal suburb the
name of ‘the Leonine city.’ These fortifications were
solemnly consecrated by the pope just a year before Alfred’s
former visit, viz. on June 27, 852<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Æthelwulf’s
second
marriage.</div>

<p>§ 57. It was on his way home in 856 that Æthelwulf
and, presumably, Alfred also, stayed once more at the
court of Charles the Bald; and here at Verberie on
October 1 the elderly Æthelwulf was married to the
emperor’s daughter Judith, a child of twelve or thirteen<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>.
The motive of this ill-assorted match is thought to have
been to cement an alliance between the two monarchs
against the wikings, who were the common foes of both.
If this was its object, it was a conspicuous failure. As far
as I can read the history of the succeeding years, whenever
the wikings were defeated on the Continent they threw
themselves on England, and conversely<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>. So that the
success of one kingdom was the disaster of the other.
There is no trace of any joint action beneficial to both.
And indeed Charles the Bald, a typical Frenchman in
many respects, intellectually clever, but caring only for the
outward pomp and circumstance of empire, without the
strength of character to grasp and hold the reality of
power<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>, was hardly the man to carry out a consistent
policy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Æthelwulf’s
return. Alleged
conspiracy
against
him.</div>

<p>‘And afterwards he came home to his people, and they
were fain thereof,’ says the Chronicle; using, in regard to
Æthelwulf’s return, almost the same simple and expressive
words which it uses afterwards to describe the joy of the
people when Alfred emerged from his retreat at Athelney.
This seems to me to give the lie direct to Asser’s story<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>—in
itself most suspicious—that Æthelwulf on his arrival
was greeted by a conspiracy of his eldest son Æthelbald,
Ealhstan, bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of
Somerset, to exclude him from the throne, and that
Æthelwulf, sooner than allow a civil war, consented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
accept the subordinate kingdom of Kent, &amp;c., leaving
Wessex to the rebellious son. We have seen that Æthelwulf,
on his departure, had divided his kingdoms between
his two eldest sons, and it is possible that Æthelbald was
less willing than Æthelberht to resign the delegated power.
The joy at Æthelwulf’s return may point to trouble in his
absence; and the same may be hinted at where it is said of
Æthelberht, that he reigned ‘in all good quietness and
peace<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>.’ This cannot refer to exemption from Danish
attacks, for it was in his reign that Winchester, the capital
of Wessex, was captured<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. One is almost tempted to think
that the writer, struck, as everyone must be struck<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>, with
the parallel between Æthelwulf and Louis the Pious,
wished to create an English counterpart to the Lügenfeld,
or Field of Lies, where Louis was betrayed into the hands
of his rebellious sons<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> (June 30, 833). Asser’s quaint
characterisation of an atrocious conspiracy as a ‘misfortune’
(infortunium), reminds one of Gibbon’s immortal
description in the autobiography of the gentleman who
‘was always talking about his faults, which he called his
misfortunes.’ Here, too, I seem to see traces of the conflation
of two different traditions<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>, which might point to the
possibility of interpolation. But even if the story be all
Asser’s own, we must remember that he was writing at
least thirty-eight years after the event; and surely we in
Oxford know that a legend may grow up in a shorter time
than that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question
of
Judith’s
marriage
with
Æthelbald.</div>

<p>§58. If Judith’s marriage to her step-son Æthelbald
rested only on the authority of this early part of Asser<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>,
I should reject it with equal decision; and with the same
sort of inclination to regard it as a fabricated pendant to
the second marriage of Louis the Pious to her grandmother,
the elder Judith, which caused so much dissension in the
Carolingian empire<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>, and was freely labelled by its opponents
as ‘incestuous,’ because the parties to it were said
to be within the prohibited degrees<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>. But the marriage of
Judith to Æthelbald is vouched for by strictly contemporary
continental authorities<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>, one of them being Hincmar, the
prelate who blessed the ceremony of her coronation<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>, so
that it is hard to set it aside. And yet it is hard to accept
it. One of the few charters of Æthelbald’s reign<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> bears
as its first three signatures, ‘Eðebald rex, Iudith regina,
Swithun episcopus.’ Did Swithun condone a flagrant case
of incest, or does ‘regina’ only mean queen-dowager?
Once more: is it not just possible that the whole story
may have grown out of a confusion of Æthelbald with
Eadbald, the son of Æthelberht of Kent, whose incestuous
marriage with his step-mother is mentioned by Bede<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>?
The difference between Eadbald and Æthelbald would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be very serious, especially to continental ears and pens.
Anyhow, we shall hardly acquiesce in the verdict of a later
continental chronicler: ‘nor did the king’s crime seem
grievous to the English, to whom the worship of God was
much unknown<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>.’</p>

<p>§ 59. Apart from his signatures to charters<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>, there is
no mention of Alfred in our authorities after his second
return from Rome till he takes his place upon the stage of
history by the side of his brother Æthelred. But no
account of Alfred’s early years could be regarded as complete
which did not include a discussion of the famous
story about his learning to read. I venture to think that
a good many unnecessary difficulties have been made about
the matter.</p>

<p>The common view may be expressed in the quaint words
of Robert of Gloucester’s rhyming Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>:—</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Illiteratus</i>
= ignorant
of
Latin.</div>

<p class="noindent">The original source of all this is of course the well-known
passage of Asser<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>, where it is said that Alfred ‘remained
illiterate’ up to his twelfth year or more, though he learned
many Saxon poems by heart. Then, after an intervening
sentence on his skill as a hunter, comes the pretty story of
the book of Saxon poems which he won by learning to read
it to his mother. Here there are several points to be
noticed. In the first place I believe that ‘illiteratus permansit’
means nothing more than that he was ignorant of
Latin. If we consider that Latin was at this time the
universal vehicle of culture in Western Europe, that ‘legere’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
is constantly used, and notably in Asser<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>, of reading Latin;
that all through the Middle Ages the decision ‘legit ut
clericus,’ which entitled an accused person to benefit of
clergy, meant that he could read Latin, this interpretation
will seem quite natural. Nor does the contrasted statement
that Alfred had picked up many Saxon poems by heart
oblige us to believe that he could not read his own language
in his thirteenth year. Asser is not so logical in his use of
conjunctions; and besides this, many, perhaps most, Saxon
poems could be acquired in no other way; since they only
existed in oral tradition. Alfred’s thirteenth year, according
to Asser’s date for his birth, would point to 861. If
we remember that we have Alfred’s own statement that
only ten years later, at his accession in 871, there was
scarcely a priest south of the Humber who knew any
Latin<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>, we shall easily see that Alfred would have little
opportunity of making good the defects of his early education
on this side before he came to the throne; and the
complaints which Asser puts in his mouth, that when he
had leisure to learn, he could find no one to teach him,
though rhetorical in form, are true enough in fact<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronology
of
the incident of
the poetry
book.</div>

<p>§ 60. Secondly, I can see nothing in the passage which
obliges us to put the incident of the poetry book in Alfred’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
thirteenth year. It is true that Asser introduces it with
an ‘ergo.’ But when we have once grasped the thoroughly
aimless way in which Asser sprinkles his conjunctions
about, we shall not be inclined to lay much stress on this.
And, if we are to construe so strictly, the ‘ergo’ couples
the incident, not to the statement of Alfred’s want of
literature, but to the sentence about his skill in hunting<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>.
The incident may belong therefore to any period anterior
to Alfred’s second visit to Rome in 855. This at once
gets rid of all the chronological difficulties which have been
evolved from the passage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
misconceptions

<p>Nor is it necessarily implied that the reading of the
poetry book was Alfred’s first essay in reading. It is
only said that he went to a master and learnt to read that
particular book. But a child would need help in mastering
a new work, even if he could read to some extent before.</p>

<p>Again, the suggestion of Pauli<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> and others that even in
this case Alfred was merely taught to say the poems by
heart, and then repeated them to his mother, is based
simply on a piece of bad scholarship. Because in the
modern languages recitation means repeating by heart, it
does not follow that that is the meaning of the Latin word.
‘Recitare’ means ‘to read aloud’; it occurs no less than
seven times in Asser, and that is the meaning of the word
in every case<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>Once more, the mother mentioned in the story is unquestionably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Alfred’s own mother Osburh. That he should
ever have spoken to Asser of Judith, who was only some
four years older than himself, with all her doubtful after-history,
as his mother, is, as Dr. Stubbs says<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>, absolutely
inconceivable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theory of

<p>Lastly, an emphatic protest must be entered against the

says<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>, in order to marry the child Judith. The object of
the theory is to get over the supposed chronological
difficulties of the incident of the poetry book. I have
tried to show that those difficulties are imaginary. But
no amount of chronological difficulties would induce me to
accept a moral impossibility like this. It would be better
to give up the story altogether. When Osburh died we do

in charters. If she died in 854 or 855<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>, grief for her loss
may have been an additional motive for Æthelwulf to seek
the spiritual consolations associated with a visit to the holy
places.</p>

death. Limitations

of Æthelwulf’s

of Æthelwulf’s

<p>§ 61. Æthelwulf did not long survive his return from
the Continent, dying about fifteen months later, January 13,
858<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. Looking back over his reign of eighteen and a half
years we seem to see that Wessex had hardly maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the advance which she had made under Egbert; and indeed
in some respects that advance was probably greater in
appearance than in reality. There is no trace of any
exercise of superiority on Æthelwulf’s part in regard to
Northumbria or East Anglia; and though it is unsafe
to argue absolutely from silence, especially where our
authorities are so meagre, the inference seems confirmed
by the title which Æthelwulf gives himself in one of his
charters, ‘Rex Australium populorum<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>,’ a district coincident
with that denoted by Asser’s Saxonia, as explained
above<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>. While a Mercian charter which makes special
provision for the entertainment of heralds (<i>praecones</i>) on
their journeys between Mercia and Northumbria, and
Mercia and Wessex<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> seems to indicate that those kingdoms
existed on a footing of equality and mutual independence.
If Burgred of Mercia’s application to Æthelwulf in 853
for help against the Welsh implies that he regarded the
latter in any way as his over-lord, it equally shows that
Egbert’s reduction of the Welsh had not been permanent.
But on the whole I agree with Mr. Green<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> that the facts
of Æthelwulf’s reign do not bear out that character of
weakness commonly ascribed to him, which rests, I think,
largely on the idea that a reputation for piety is incompatible
with mental vigour. The hold of Wessex on Kent
and its dependencies was not relaxed. Egbert himself had
found it expedient to conciliate local feeling by making his
son Æthelwulf under-king of these districts<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>, a system for
which he could have pleaded the example of the great
Charles, with which he must have become acquainted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the days of his exile<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>. The same system was continued
at Egbert’s death, and again at Æthelwulf’s departure for
Rome, and at his death; the latter division being prescribed,
according to Asser<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>, by the terms of Æthelwulf’s
will. Whether Æthelwulf really did venture to fly so
much in the face of Mr. Freeman, as to dispose of his
dominions by will, cannot be certainly known, as the will
is not in existence. Anyhow, in view of the earlier
precedents, I hesitate to accept the theory of Lappenberg
and Pauli, that Æthelwulf intended definitely to sever
Kent, &amp;c., from Wessex, entailing it on the descendants
of Æthelberht, who in turn were to remain excluded from
the Wessex succession<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>. Possibly Kent was not at once
ripe for incorporation with Wessex, and the arrangement
may have been justified as a transitional measure. Happily
it came to an end on Æthelbald’s death in 860; Æthelberht
retained Kent on his accession to Wessex<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>; Æthelred
on this occasion, and Alfred, on the death of Æthelberht,
patriotically abstaining from pressing the claims to Kent,
which they might have based on the recent precedents.
And this I take to be the residuum of fact in Asser’s
rhetorical statement<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> that Alfred might, if he liked, have
assumed the royal power during his brother’s lifetime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reign of
Æthelbald. New
phase
of the

struggle
under

<p>§ 62. Of Æthelbald’s short reign of two and a half
years nothing is recorded in the Chronicle; Asser’s statement<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
that his government was ‘unbridled,’ I regard as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a mere flourish, based on his alleged incestuous marriage;
while Henry of Huntingdon’s pathetic sigh that ‘at his
death England realised how much she had lost<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>,’ I take to
be an equally valuable piece of rhetoric on the other side.
With Æthelberht’s reign of rather over five years the
Danish struggle<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> enters on a new and more serious phase.
Under him, as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>, Winchester was taken in the
year 860, and though the assailants were ultimately driven
off, a severe blow must have been struck at the prestige of
Wessex by the capture of her capital<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. The wintering
of the Danes in Thanet in 865, marks, according to Steenstrup<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>,
the beginning of the deliberate and systematic
attempt to conquer England. The recent incorporation of
Kent with Wessex did not prevent the Kentishmen from
making a separate agreement with the foe. The next
year, 866, the Danes wintered in East Anglia, and there
too a separate peace was made, to be followed, four years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
later, by the definite conquest of that land, and the death
of its martyr-king, St. Edmund. In 867 the never-ending
civil discords of Northumbria opened that country also to
the invaders; and there too a separate peace was made,
and a puppet king, Egbert, was set up by the Danes<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> in
the district north of the Tyne, just as they set up Ceolwulf,
a few years later, in Mercia. Mercia’s turn was to come
the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accession
of Æthelred;

<p>But meanwhile, in 866, Æthelred had succeeded his
brother Æthelberht on the throne of Wessex, and it is under
Æthelred that the public life of Alfred begins. A late
authority<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> states that Æthelred was Alfred’s favourite
brother. The statement is probably a mere inference from
the record of their co-operation contained in the Chronicle
and Asser; but in itself it is likely enough.</p>

<p>In 868 the Danes invaded Mercia and wintered at
Nottingham. Burgred, who with his Witan had in 853
invoked Æthelwulf’s help against the Welsh, and who
that same year had married Æthelwulf’s only daughter
Ealhswith, now once more with his Witan invoked the aid
of Æthelred and Alfred against this newer and much more
dangerous foe. The brothers obeyed the call, and marched
to Nottingham, but they did not venture to attack the
Danish lines, and the Mercians made peace with the
invaders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Title of
<i>secundarius</i>
given to
Alfred by
Asser. Significance
of
the title. Alfred’s
will.</div>

<p>§ 63. It will have been noticed that the Mercian application
for West Saxon help is said to have been made to
Æthelred and Alfred jointly<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>; and it is significant that it
is just before this Mercian campaign that Asser first applies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to Alfred the title <i>secundarius</i><a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> alluded to in an earlier
section. This title is unique in English history. Apart
from Asser and writers who copy Asser, the only instances
of the use of the word given by Ducange are as the title
of a monastic officer. And this to some extent confirms
the suggestion already made<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>, that the word is to be traced
to Celtic influence; for in Irish <i>secnab</i>, literally ‘second
abbot,’ is one of the regular titles of the prior of a
monastery. And I look on ‘secundarius’ as the equivalent
of the Irish ‘tanist,’ the person appointed or elected
during the lifetime of the chief as his future successor<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>;
and it is to be remarked that the Irish word <i>tanaise</i> or
<i>tanaiste</i>, anglicised ‘tanist,’ actually means ‘secundus.’ The
institution of tanistry existed among the Welsh<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>, though
I have not come across any name for it so closely corresponding
with the meaning of ‘secundarius’ as the Irish
<i>tanaiste</i>. What then I take to be the significance of the
title as applied to Alfred is this: that some time between
Æthelred’s accession in 866 and 868 a definite agreement
was come to, by which Alfred was recognised as Æthelred’s
successor, to the exclusion, for the present at any rate, of
the latter’s children (if at this time he had any); Alfred in
return perhaps definitely abandoning any claim to Kent.
This theory derives some confirmation from the very
similar arrangement which was come to about this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in regard to the private landed property belonging to the
brothers. In the preamble to Alfred’s will it is stated that
Æthelwulf left certain property to be held in common by
the three brothers, Æthelbald, Æthelred, and Alfred, the
ultimate survivor to have the whole. On the death of
Æthelbald, ‘Æthelred and I,’ says Alfred, ‘gave our share
in trust to our kinsman<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>, King Æthelberht, on condition that
he restored it to us [i.e. at his death] in the same state as
he received it. And he did so, not only in respect of that
property which he obtained by our concurrence, but also in
respect of that which he himself acquired.’ When Æthelred
succeeded, Alfred suggested in the Witan a final division
of the property. Æthelred pointed out the difficulty of
division, and promised that, if Alfred would withdraw his
proposal, he (Æthelred) would leave him not only the
whole of the joint property, but also that acquired by himself
separately. To this Alfred agreed. The next clause
recites how certain modifications were made at a later time,
because the Danish troubles had brought home to the
brothers that, under the original agreement, the children
of the one who died first might be left without any
provision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This will
refers to
private
property
only; not
to the
Crown.</div>

<p>§ 64. It is to be observed in the first place that this
will, and the provisions of Æthelwulf’s will therein recited,
have to do solely with the private property of the family;
there is not a word about the royal succession. It is only
in the Latin version that this is mentioned; and that the
Latin is not the original, is proved by the fact that it is
full of the most obvious mistranslations from the Saxon.
Indeed, I am not sure that the introduction of the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
succession is not the result of a mistranslation<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>. Secondly,
the inclusion of Æthelbald is rather against the story of
his rebellion; while on the other hand the omission of
Æthelberht is to be accounted for on the supposition that
he had been provided for in other clauses of the will, not
here recited; for Asser distinctly says<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> that Æthelwulf
divided his private property between his sons and his
daughter. However, notwithstanding the exclusion of
Æthelberht from this particular portion of the inheritance,
Æthelred and Alfred made it over to him, on condition
that at his death they should receive, not only it, but also
his separate property; in other words, they made much the
same agreement as was ultimately made between Æthelred
and Alfred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But
analogous
arrangements
were
probably
made as
to the succession. These
explain
the title
<i>secundarius</i>.</div>

<p>The latter agreement was made, says Alfred, when
Æthelred had succeeded; that is, shortly after 866. It
does not seem to me unreasonable to suppose that some
arrangement was made at the same time with reference to
the succession, and sanctioned in the same Witenagemót.
Alfred’s marriage took place according to Asser in 868,
the very year of the Mercian expedition. Whether at the
time of the agreement about the private property any of
Æthelred’s children had been born is uncertain. The subsequent
modifications, providing for the children of the
two brothers, would seem to suggest that they had not.
Anyhow they must have been too young to be contemplated
as possible successors, in the not unlikely event of Æthelred’s
falling in battle; and the danger of the country required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that there should be no uncertainty on the question of the
succession. It is by this definite recognition of Alfred as
successor that I would explain the title of ‘secundarius’
given to him by Asser. I may add that, except as to the
Celtic analogies which I have suggested, this is practically
the view of Dr. Stubbs<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>, though I was not conscious of
the fact when I worked out my own theory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Alfred’s
Year of
Battles.’ Chronology.</div>

<p>§ 65. For two years Wessex had a respite. The year
869 was spent by the invaders in Deira with their headquarters
at York. In 870, as already mentioned, they
completed their conquest of East Anglia. But in the
following year the storm burst. This was indeed ‘Alfred’s
Year of Battles,’ as it is called by the late Mr. W. H.
Simcox in an excellent article on the subject, which he
contributed to the second number of the English Historical
Review<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>. Here, as seven years later, the object of the
Danes seems to have been to surprise Wessex by an attack
in mid-winter. Mr. Simcox, by reckoning back the intervals
between the various engagements as given in the Chronicle
from the death of Æthelred, which is stated to have occurred
‘after Easter,’ placed the beginning of the campaign in
January. But a fact, first pointed out, as far as I know,
by Sir James Ramsay<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>, enables us to fix it more precisely.
Heahmund, bishop of Sherborne, fell in the battle of
Marton, the last engagement in which Æthelred took part.
So little was his warlike activity held to derogate from his
episcopal character, that his death in battle against a
heathen foe won him the title of martyr<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>, and a place in
the calendar. His day is March 22, and that would almost
certainly be the day on which he fell; and this fits in well
with the statement of the Chronicle that the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Marton was before Easter, which fell on April 15 in 871<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.
Reckoning backward from this we get January 22 for the
English defeat at Basing, January 8 for the victory of
Ashdown, January 4 for the abortive attack on the Danish
lines at Reading, December 31 for the successful engagement
at Englefield, and December 28 for the descent of
the Danes on Reading. These two last dates according to
our reckoning belong to 870; but the Chronicler, who begins
his year with Christmas Day<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>, is quite correct in placing
them in 871.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Danes at
Reading. Battle of
Ashdown.</div>

<p>The Danes seized Reading and fortified the tongue of
land between the Kennet and the Thames<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>; a large
foraging party under two jarls was cut up by Æthelwulf,
the ealdorman of Berkshire, at Englefield, but the main
attack by the royal brothers on the Danish lines at
Reading failed, and here the victor of Englefield was
slain. Gaimar gives some details as to the route by which
the defeated English made their escape, which seem to me
perfectly genuine, though I know not whence he derived
them<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>. Mr. Simcox objects to them on military grounds,
of which I do not profess to be a judge. Anyhow, only
four days later the English gained the brilliant victory of
Ashdown, about five-and-twenty miles further to the west.
I confess I find it difficult to fit into the Chronicler’s account
of the battle the well-known anecdote of Asser<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>, which
tells how Æthelred refused to engage until the priest had
finished saying mass, though Mr. Simcox accepts it as
‘perfectly historical.’ However, if true, Æthelred’s delay
had no bad effect on the result of the battle; and the
bringing up of a fresh body of troops after the enemy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
already been disordered by Alfred’s ‘boar-like’ charge<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>,
may have largely contributed to the victory. So that the
cheap sneers of some writers have not the merit of being
even superficially effective.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ashdown
thorn.</div>

<p>We have noticed<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> that among the objects of interest
which Asser claims to have seen with his own eyes was
the solitary thorn round which the battle of Ashdown
raged. It is an interesting fact, first pointed out to me
by my friend Mr. Taylor, that among the Berkshire
Hundreds enumerated in Domesday is one called Nachededorn,
i.e. Naked-thorn, containing within itself a manor
of the same name, and also the manor of Ashdown<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. As
the name of a hundred, ‘Naked-thorn’ has perished; and
the manors which it contained are by modern arrangements
distributed among several hundreds. But it was suggested
by Dr. Wilson, formerly President of Trinity College,
Oxford<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>, that the name of ‘Naked-thorn’ manor probably
survived in a slightly altered form in the name of Roughthorn
Farm, close to Ashdown<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>. The manor of Naked-thorn
was held by the Conqueror in demesne; that of
Ashdown by Henry de Ferrers. It is certainly, as
Mr. Taylor remarks, an interesting fact that the site of
the battle of Ashdown should have been owned by the
Conqueror himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battles of
Basing and Marton. Death of
Æthelred.</div>

<p>From Ashdown the beaten Danes withdrew to their lines
at Reading. A fortnight later fortune turned once more,
and the English were defeated at Basing. This southward
movement seems to indicate that the Danes were striking
for Winchester, the capital of Wessex<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>. The fact that
they were unable to press the attack home, shows that the
English, though defeated, were still formidable. Then for
two months our authorities are silent. The Chronicler tells
us that in this year of battles there were no less than nine
general engagements<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>, not counting minor operations.
But of these nine engagements only six are actually
named, Englefield, Reading, Ashdown, Basing, Marton,
Wilton. It is just possible that one or more of the
unnamed battles may have taken place in the interval.
The next engagement, however, that we hear of was at
a place called by the Chronicler Meretun, which is neither
Merton in Surrey, nor Merton near Bicester, nor (as
I once thought) Marden near Devizes, but, as Mr. Simcox
argues with great probability, Marton, about three miles
south of Great Bedwin in Wiltshire; and here the English,
at first victorious, had ultimately to yield possession of the
field of battle, and a month later, shortly after Easter<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>,
Æthelred died. Whether he was wounded in the battle<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>,
or whether he was simply worn out by the incessant strain
and exposure of the last four months, he equally died for
England and the Faith, and it is difficult to read with
patience the depreciatory comments of some writers,
who seem here also to assume that piety and efficiency
must be mutually exclusive qualities. But with Alfred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>

the whole people<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>. Our primary authorities tell us nothing
of this<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>; and though their silence is not conclusive<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>,
a formal election would probably be rendered unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
by the arrangement already come to with reference to the
succession; while it certainly was no time for coronation
festivities or anything of that kind. Even before Æthelred’s
death a new force of wikings, ‘a summer army<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>’ as opposed
to those who had wintered in the land, invaded the country.
Æthelred was interred at Wimborne, where, in Asser’s words,
‘he awaits the coming of the Lord, and the first resurrection
with the just<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>.’ Even while Alfred was busied with his
brother’s exequies, an engagement was being fought in
his absence. Ethelwerd alone tells us of this engagement<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>;
and at one time I supposed<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> that his account was
merely a mistaken version of the battle of Wilton, but
I am now convinced that his account is distinct, and that
it is not improbable in itself. If I understand him rightly,
and he is never very easy to understand, the new force of
wikings came to Reading, where they were joined by the
Danes who had wintered in the country; and together
they defeated an English force, which was in no great
numbers, owing to the absence of the king. If this is
correct, we have here one of the unnamed ‘folc-gefeoht’ of
the Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>. But though Ethelwerd calls it a barren
victory<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> for the Danes, it seems to have opened to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the heart of Wessex, for the next engagement was fought
at Wilton, a month after Æthelred’s death, that is towards
the end of May, where another of those enigmatic contests
took place, in which the Danes are put to flight, and yet
encamp upon the field of battle. Possibly the Danes,
whether in real or pretended flight, turned upon their
disorderly pursuers and defeated them. This seems to be
distinctly suggested by Asser’s narrative<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>. After this,
peace was made, probably by purchase, and a respite was
well worth paying for. The Danes had suffered scarcely
less than the West Saxons<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>, and for four whole years they
avoided Wessex. The question has been asked: Why did
not Burgred of Mercia come to the help of his brothers-in-law
in their hour of need, as they had come to help him
three years before? Mr. Simcox points out that here too
the despised Ingulf<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> supplies the right answer. Burgred
was detained by an incursion of the Welsh, acting, no
doubt, in concert with the Danes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Danes at
London. Their exactions. They
overrun
Mercia.</div>

<p>§ 67. After this peace, the Danes moved from Reading,
which had remained their head-quarters, to London, where
they spent the winter of 871-2, and forced the Mercians
once more to purchase peace. Alfred seems to have kept
at any rate an army of observation in the neighbourhood.
For a later annal, speaking of the alms sent by Alfred to
Rome and India in 883<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>, says that this was in fulfilment
of a vow made ‘when they encamped against the host at
London. And through God’s mercy,’ adds the pious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Chronicler, ‘they fully obtained their prayer after that
vow.’ Whether these last words refer to an actual defeat
inflicted on the Danes by Alfred, or only to his success in
keeping them out of Wessex, we cannot tell. In either
case the notice illustrates very strikingly the fragmentary
nature of even our best authorities. The weight of the
exactions which Burgred had to impose to raise the ransom
for the Danes, is illustrated by a lease executed this very
year (872) of lands belonging to the see of Worcester,
which was necessitated ‘owing to the enormous tribute in
the year when the heathen sat in London<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>.’ The next
year the Danes moved northwards and wintered at Torksey,
872-3. The next winter, 873-4, was spent at Repton,
and in 874, after destroying that mausoleum of the Mercian
kings<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>, they overran the whole of Mercia, drove out Burgred,
who withdrew to Rome to die; and set up in his place for
the present a puppet king in the person of ‘an unwise
king’s thane,’ as the Chronicle quaintly calls him, named
Ceolwulf, ‘an Englishman by race, but a barbarian in
cruelty<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>.’ In 875 the Danes divided their forces, and part
went to the Tyne and part went to Cambridge. The only
event recorded in connexion with the history of Wessex in
this year is the defeat, by Alfred in person<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>, as it would
seem, of a small fleet of seven wiking ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>§ 68. But in 876 the Cambridge division of the Danes
managed to slip past the Saxon ‘fyrd,’ and get into
Wareham, the ancient importance of which is still attested
by the large quadrangular earthworks<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>. We do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
what time of year this was; but apparently the Danes
stayed there till the following winter<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>; when Alfred found
it expedient to make peace with them, by purchase, according
to Ethelwerd; the Danes giving hostages, and swearing
their most binding oaths on the sacred temple-ring, ‘on
which they would never swear before to any people.’ Yet
in spite of this, the negotiations were only a blind on the
part of the Danes, and under cover of them they took to
their horses, and slipped away by night to Exeter. This
seems to have been early in 877. Alfred failed to overtake
them before they reached Exeter, and he did not venture to
attack them behind their fortifications<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. But he sat down
and blockaded them by land, and, if a later account may be
trusted<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>, his ships watched the mouth of the Exe. Meanwhile
a wiking fleet of 120 sail was making its way west
about from East Anglia, no doubt with the view of throwing
supplies and reinforcements into Exeter. But off the
coast of Swanage they were caught in a violent storm,
and in Gaimar’s uncomplimentary language, who rather
exaggerates the number of the fleet, ‘140 ships went to
the devils<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>.’ But for the wreck of these 120 ships the
issue of the campaign, perhaps even of the whole war,
might have been very different<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>. The motto on a Dutch
medal struck to commemorate the ruin of the Armada in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
1588 would apply here also: ‘Flauit et dissipati sunt<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>.’
‘Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them:
they sank as lead in the mighty waters<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.’ And so the
Danes in Exeter were fain to submit, and swore mighty
oaths, which for once they kept, and withdrew to Mercia,
which they now partitioned, dividing part of it among
themselves, and restoring the remainder to their puppet
Ceolwulf. This partition is of some prospective importance
as being probably the origin of the distinction between
English and Danish Mercia<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>.</p>

<p>§ 69. Of the sudden swoop of the Danes on Chippenham
in January, 878, and Alfred’s retirement to Athelney I have
said enough above<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>. It was at Easter, March 23, 878,
that Alfred and his little band reared the fort on Athelney.
Some seven weeks later, that is to say, about the middle
of May, he moved out of it to Brixton Deverill near
Warminster. The date of this movement must have
been carefully fixed, and widely made known by Alfred’s
messengers beforehand. For here he was joined at once
by the levies of Somerset, Wilts., and part of Hampshire,
‘and they were fain of him,’ says the Chronicler, in words
the more expressive for their extreme simplicity. How
effectually the preliminary arrangements had been made, is
shown by the fact that the very next day Alfred was able
to continue his forward movement to Leigh near Westbury,
and the next day to Edington<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>. Here a general engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was fought with the whole Danish army under
Guthrum, which had moved out of Chippenham. The
result was a complete victory for Alfred: ‘he put them
to flight, and rode after them to their fort, and sat down
before it for a fortnight, and then the host (<i>here</i>) gave him
leading hostages and swore mighty oaths that they would
quit his realm. And they further promised that their king
should receive baptism. And so it was performed, and
three weeks later [that is, about the end of the first week
in June] the king Guthrum, with twenty-nine of those
that were worthiest in the host, came to him at Aller near
Athelney; and the king received him at baptism, and his
chrism-loosing was at Wedmore; and he was twelve nights
with the king, and he honoured him much, and feed his
followers.’ The ‘fort’ to which Alfred pursued his flying
foes was, I think, the Danish lines at Chippenham; and
though high authorities, including Professor Earle, take
a different view<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>, I am glad to see that I am supported by
our military historian, Professor Oman<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>. The submission
of the Danes would be furthered by a great disaster which
befell another body of them earlier in the year. A wiking
fleet, which had wintered in South Wales<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>, crossed to the
opposite coast of Devon; probably intending, after ravaging
the southern coast of the Bristol Channel, as they had
already ravaged the northern coast, to effect a junction
with the Danes at Chippenham. The men of Devon,
under their ealdorman Odda, took refuge in a rude fort<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
probably Kenny Castle near Appledore. The Danes, under
Ubba, the brother of Halfdene and Ingwar<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>, expected an
easy victory, but the English, sallying out unexpectedly at
early dawn, put their foes to rout, slaying over 800 of them,
and driving the rest to their ships<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>. The mystic Raven
Banner fell into the hands of the victors. After the
ceremony at Wedmore the Danes retired, in accordance
with their promise, to Cirencester<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>, and the next year, 879,
they withdrew altogether to East Anglia; while a body of
wikings, which had gathered at Fulham, crossed to the
Continent. It would seem that, whether by formal compact
or no<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>, not only Wessex and its dependencies but
English Mercia west of Watling Street was cleared of the
invader.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss and
gain. The gain
outweighs
the loss.</div>

<p>‘The long night has rolled away.’—‘Yea, even like
as a dream when one awaketh, so shalt Thou make
their image to vanish.’—Every historian is agreed that
this is the turning-point in the history, not only of
England, but of Western Europe. ‘Wessex was saved;
and in saving Wessex, Alfred saved England; and in
saving England, he saved Western Europe from becoming
a heathen Scandinavian power<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.’ In recognising the
Danish occupation of East Anglia, Eastern Mercia, and
Northumbria, Alfred was hardly making a cession, for they
had never been his to cede; he was at most giving up
a shadowy overlordship which neither he, nor his brothers,
nor, probably, even his father had ever exercised. The only
district which was in strictness ceded was Essex; and it
was a heavy loss that London remained for some years
longer a Danish city. But the gains far outweighed the
losses; and we can but ask in wonder what were the causes
of so great a change. Some light is gained when we have
realised that Alfred at Athelney was not burning cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but organising victory. Then, too, he had good helpers.
We have seen what Odda did in Devonshire; and Ethelwerd
lays stress on the co-operation of Æthelnoth, the
ealdorman of Somerset, in the dark days of Athelney<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>.
There is nothing like work in common for a great cause,
in face of great difficulties, for cementing friendship<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>, and
perhaps it is to these days that Werferth of Worcester
looks back when in one of his charters he speaks of
Æthelnoth as ‘the friend of us all<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mobility
of the
Danes.</div>

<p>§ 71. Another and very important point is this. The
chief difficulties of our forefathers under Alfred, as of us,
their descendants, in South Africa at the present day, arose
from the extreme mobility of the enemy<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>, and the way in
which they used the horses which they brought with them
or captured<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>, not indeed for fighting (that was never either
the Danish or the Saxon mode of warfare), but for dashing
from point to point, and eluding<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> and surprising the enemy.
They were, in modern phrase, mounted infantry. It would
seem as if the English were learning to copy them in this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
You may have noticed that in the extract from the Chronicle
which I read just now, describing the sequel of the
battle of Edington, it is said that Alfred ‘<i>rode</i> after the
enemy to their fort.’ The only other occasion up to this
campaign<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>, where any such phrase is used of an English
force, is in the preceding year, where the Chronicler
describes the brave but ineffectual dash which Alfred made
to try and intercept the treacherous Danes before they got
into Exeter<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
personal
influence.</div>

<p>But after all, the greatest of all human causes of success
(though it is not merely human) is contained in those
words of the Chronicler already quoted, ‘they were fain of
him.’ The personality of Alfred was beginning to tell,
and to rally to itself all that was worthiest in the nation.
It has been compared, not unaptly, to the resurrection of
France under Joan of Arc<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparative
peace. Revolt of
the East
Anglian
Danes.</div>

<p>§ 72. For the next few years Alfred had comparative
peace, the Danes being mostly occupied on the Continent.
There was a small, but successful, naval engagement in
881 or 882<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>, and in 884<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> a body of the enemy landed in
Kent and laid siege to Rochester, throwing up their usual
fortifications round their own positions. But the besieged
defended themselves successfully till Alfred came with the
fyrd, and the besiegers were in their turn besieged, and
withdrew, possibly by agreement, to the Continent once
more, leaving their prisoners, and the horses which they
had brought with them from over seas, in Alfred’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
hands<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>. The appearance of their kinsmen in Kent seems
to have been too much for the loyalty of the Danes in
East Anglia. ‘They broke the peace with King Alfred<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>.’
Alfred at once sent his fleet from Kent<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>, where it had no
doubt been supporting his operations at Rochester, across
the broad estuary of the Thames, and at the mouth of the
Stour, between Essex and Suffolk, the English defeated
and captured a fleet of sixteen sail; but on their way back
were met by a superior fleet of East Anglian Danes, and
defeated in their turn. It will be remembered that it is
in reference to this defeat that the earlier writer in Simeon
of Durham gives us the wonderful story based on the
corrupt reading in Asser of ‘dormiret’ for ‘domum iret<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred
wins
London.</div>

<p>§ 73. The next stage in the liberation of England was
a very important one, being nothing less than the acquisition
of London by Alfred. This is placed by the Chronicle in
886. But we have seen that the Chronicle is here in
advance by a year of the true chronology; the true date is
therefore probably 885. It is clear that Alfred did not
gain this great success without the use of force<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>; and
I am inclined to see in this the culmination of the measures
which he took to chastise the East Anglian Danes for
their breach of the peace in the preceding year<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>. It is
with this that we must associate the document known as
Alfred and Guthrum’s peace<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>, often wrongly confused with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the settlement of 878. By this treaty the boundaries of
878 were materially modified in Alfred’s favour. They
now ran up the Thames to the mouth of the Lea, up
the Lea to its source, thence to Bedford, and so up the
Ouse to Watling Street. By this, not only London,
but a considerable district east of Watling Street was
made over to Alfred. The Danes had paid heavily for
their momentary treachery. But again it illustrates the
fragmentary nature of our sources, that we hear nothing
of the military operations which must have led up to this
success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
this on
Alfred’s
position. Alfred,
the second
founder of
London.</div>

<p>It had an immense effect upon Alfred’s position, and
made him more clearly than ever the head of the nation.
‘There submitted to him the whole Angle-kin that was
not in subjection to the Danes.’ The city was restored and
fortified, and committed to the care of Alfred’s son-in-law,
Æthelred, whom soon after 878<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> he had made ealdorman
of the part of Mercia which fell to him by the settlement
of that year. Once, in 851, under Berhtwulf, the Danes
had captured London; they had occupied it in 872 under
Burgred; it had fallen to their share at the division of
Mercia in 877. But never again, after Alfred’s restoration
of it, was it ever forcibly captured by them or by any other
foreign host. Alfred is rightly called the second founder
of London<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peace.</div>

<p>Once more, for a few years, Alfred had peace. In 889
or 890 his old enemy and god-son, Guthrum-Athelstan
of East Anglia, died. How far he had really become
a Christian we cannot tell. In spite of his baptism Ethelwerd
uncharitably dismisses him below: ‘he breathed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
his soul to Orcus<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>.’ But for the present the Danes of
East Anglia made no movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The final
storm.</div>

<p>§ 74. In 892 the final storm burst on England; but the
result was only to show the strength of the system which
Alfred had built up during the years of peace<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>. The
splendid annals 893-7 (892-6 according to the true
chronology), in which, as has been said, we seem to hear
the very voice of Alfred himself<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>, and beside which, as the
same authority declares<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>, ‘every other piece of prose not
in these Chronicles merely, but throughout the whole range
of extant Saxon literature, must assume a secondary rank,’
give us some insight into the reforms which Alfred had
effected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
reforms;
(1) the
<i>fyrd</i>
divided.</div>

<p>(1) To counteract the standing weakness of citizen-armies,
which made them liable to melt away at the
critical moment, when their short term of service was
expired, he divided the fyrd into two divisions, which were
to relieve one another at fixed intervals, ‘so that always
half were at home, and half on service.’ This measure is
particularly interesting, as it may have been suggested to
Alfred by his studies in Orosius, where a similar institution
is attributed to the Amazons, and in Alfred’s translation is
described in language very similar to that of the Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2) Fortifications.</div>

<p>(2) Besides the two alternating divisions of the fyrd, the
Chronicle enumerates ‘the men who were bound to keep
the burgs<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.’ If the Danes had taught the Saxons the
importance of mobility when in movement, they had no
less surely taught them the importance of fortifications
when stationary. In the first place the towns were encouraged
to fortify themselves—we have a very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
document, unfortunately without date, which tells how
Æthelred of Mercia, and his wife, Æthelflæd, lady of
the Mercians, ‘bade work the burg at Worcester for the
protection of all the people<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>’; while in 898 there was
a formal conference at Chelsea between Alfred, Æthelred,
Æthelflæd, and Archbishop Plegmund on the fortifications
of London<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>. But besides this, fortified camps were erected
at strategic points. The important document known as
the burghal hidage<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>, which is only a very little later than
Alfred’s reign, seems to show that certain districts were
appurtenant to these burgs, while ‘the men who were
bound to keep the burgs’ would possibly hold their lands
by a tenure analogous to that known under the feudal
system as ‘castle-guard.’ Asser also insists strongly on
the importance which Alfred attached to the construction
of ‘castella’ or ‘arces’ (= burgs); though he also shows
that Alfred had considerable difficulty in getting his subjects
to adopt this novel mode of defence<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>. It would
seem then that, in creating the famous lines of forts by
which Edward and Æthelflæd secured the country which
they won from the Danes, they were but carrying out the
policy of their father<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3) Number
of
thanes increased.</div>

<p>(3) It seems to have been part of Alfred’s military
policy to increase considerably the number of thanes, by
conferring the privileges, and enforcing the obligations of
thanehood on all owners of five hides of land, an estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
analogous to the later knight’s fee. This would give the
king a nucleus of highly equipped troops, whom he could
moreover call out on his own authority, without going
through the form of consulting the Witan<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>. It can
hardly be a mere accident that, whereas in the records of
Alfred’s reign, the only mention of king’s thanes hitherto
has been in connexion with the minor military operations
of the great ‘year of battles,’ 871, in the annals 894-7
they are mentioned no less than six times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(4) Greater
mobility.</div>

<p>(4) These annals also furnish abundant evidence of that
increased mobility of the English forces which we have
already noticed. They also show</p>

<div class="sidenote">(5) Fortified
positions
carried.</div>

<p>(5) That the English had learned not only to make
fortifications, but to storm them<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>. After this preamble
we return to the history of Alfred’s last contest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
the Dyle. Renewed
invasion
of England
by
the Danes. A concerted
attempt to
conquer
England. Danish
plan of
campaign. Battle of
Farnham.</div>

<p>§ 75. On November 1, 891<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>, Arnulf, king of the Eastern
Franks, had defeated the Northmen in a brilliant engagement
on the Dyle, which freed the interior of Germany
for ever from these foes. This, and the famine which
prevailed on the Continent in 892 in consequence of an
exceptionally severe winter, disgusted them with their
continental quarters; and in the autumn of 892<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> a fleet
of 250 sail put forth from Boulogne, and entered the
mouth of the then navigable river Lymne, drew their
ships four miles up the river, and, after capturing an
unfinished<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> fort, entrenched themselves at Appledore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Shortly after, a smaller detachment of eighty ships under
Hæsten sailed into the estuary of the Thames, entered the
Swale, and fortified itself at Milton. In view of these
new encampments on English soil, Alfred, early in 893
(894), exacted oaths from the Northumbrian and East
Anglian Danes, with hostages in addition from the latter,
that they would take no part with the invaders. This is
the first time that we have had mention of any dealings of
Alfred with the Northumbrian Danes, and it shows what
new possibilities were opening before him; while, on the
other side, the important part which, in spite of their
oaths, the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes took
in the following struggle, and the fact that the new invaders
brought their wives and children with them, prove
that this was no mere predatory raid, but a deliberate and
concerted attempt to conquer England. Alfred with his
fyrd took up a position between the two Danish camps, so
as to watch them both. Numerous small skirmishes took
place, but no general engagement. Meanwhile Alfred was
negotiating with the smaller body of Danes at Milton;
whom he may have thought to detach by making a separate
agreement with them. Hæsten entered into negotiations,
and even allowed his two sons to be baptised, Alfred himself
and Æthelred of Mercia acting as sponsors. But on
the part of Hæsten the negotiations were only a blind;
if indeed they had not been originally proposed by
him with this object. While they were in progress, he
ordered the Danes at Appledore to send their ships round
to Benfleet in Essex, and themselves to break out in force,
and marching through Surrey, Hampshire, and Berkshire,
cross the upper Thames, and then, turning eastwards,
regain their ships at Benfleet, to which he himself now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
crossed, threw up a fortification, and occupied himself with
harrying the districts, which had been ceded to Alfred
by the settlement of 885 (886). This plan was put into
execution. But though the Danes at Appledore succeeded
in breaking out, they were pursued by the fyrd under
Alfred’s eldest son Edward<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>, which overtook them (or, in
the Chronicler’s words, ‘<i>rode</i> before them’), compelled
them to fight a general engagement at Farnham, in which
the Danes were defeated, and driven in confusion across the
Thames, and up the Hertfordshire Colne, where they took
refuge in an island called Thorney<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>, which the fyrd proceeded
to blockade. Unfortunately at this crisis the term
of service of Edward’s division of the fyrd expired, and
their provisions being exhausted they were forced to raise
the blockade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danes in the
west.</div>

<p>Alfred was on his way to relieve them with the other
division of the fyrd, when he heard<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> that two fleets of
Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes were operating in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the west, the larger one of 100 ships besieging Exeter, the
smaller one of forty ships besieging an unnamed fort on
the coast of North Devon. Alfred at once hurried westward,
detaching however a small force under Edward to
watch the Danes at Thorney. Alfred was ultimately<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
successful in raising the siege of Exeter; the fate of the
North Devon fort is not recorded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward
reduces
the Danes
in
Thorney. Capture
of Benfleet.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Edward, reinforced by Æthelred from London,
renewed the blockade of Thorney, the Danes having been
unable to avail themselves of his temporary absence, owing
to the fact that their chief had been wounded in the battle
of Farnham. They had accordingly to submit and give
hostages, and were then allowed to march off. Edward
and Æthelred returned to London, and collecting reinforcements
there and from the west, marched to Benfleet, which
they found garrisoned by their former antagonists from
Thorney; Hæsten himself with his division being away
plundering. The fort was carried, the garrison put to
flight, all the women, and children, and plunder captured;
Hæsten’s own wife and sons were among the captives,
though either now or later Alfred chivalrously restored
them, because of the relationship which baptism had
created between them. The ships were burned or broken
up, or carried off to London and Rochester. It was as
complete a victory as could well be imagined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Danes

England. They are

northwards, defeated

<p>§ 76. The defeated Danes fell back on Shoebury, where
they were joined by Hæsten, and threw up another fortification.
They then set out to march up the Thames,
being joined by large reinforcements from Northumbria
and East Anglia. The object of this move was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to co-operate with their friends in Devonshire against
Alfred’s force. If so, it was frustrated. The three great
ealdormen, Æthelred of Mercia, Æthelnoth of Somerset,
and Æthelhelm of Wilts., ‘with the thanes who were at
home at the forts,’ raised a levy, the extent of which, as
Professor Earle has remarked<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>, seems to astonish the
Chronicler himself, ‘from every burg east of Parret, west
and east of Selwood, north of Thames, west of Severn,
with some of the North Welsh’; the co-operation of these
last being especially noteworthy. In view of these gathering
forces the Danes were obliged to head off northwards
up the Severn valley, being finally overtaken at Buttington,
and blockaded on both sides of the river. The locality
of this place has been much disputed; some authorities
placing it at Buttington Tump, at the junction of the Wye
with the Severn, others identifying it with Buttington on
the borders of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire. Contrary
to my former opinion, I am now inclined to take the latter
view; not because of Sir James Ramsay’s objection that
the Severn is too wide to be blockaded at Buttington Tump,
for on that theory the river on which the Danes were
blockaded would be the Wye; but because the phrase of
the Chronicler that the Danes marched ‘up along Severn,’
just as they had marched ‘up along Thames,’ seems to
imply that they followed the Severn valley northwards;
whereas to reach Buttington Tump they would have had to
cross the Severn and turn south; and moreover, in that
case, their fleets in Devonshire would probably have made
some attempt to relieve them. However this may be, the
English blockaded them for ‘many weeks,’ until they were
starved out, their horses having all died of hunger or been
eaten. They then made a desperate attempt to break
through the English lines on the eastern side of the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
but were defeated with loss; those who escaped returning
to Shoebury; then, leaving their ships, their women, and
their booty in East Anglia, and drawing in large reinforcements
from East Anglia and Northumbria, they made
a sudden dash across England, marching ‘without stopping<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
day or night,’ till they reached the ruined Roman
walls of Chester, where they fortified themselves for the
winter. The fyrd failed to cut them off before they reached
Chester, and the approach of winter and the heavy work
already done probably prevented them from attempting
another blockade; they therefore contented themselves with
destroying everything in the neighbourhood from which
the Danes could gather sustenance, and retired. Not since
the great year of battles in 871 had there been such a bustling
year in England, and what a different result!</p>

<div class="sidenote">They
fortify
themselves
on
the Lea, but are
out-manœuvred.</div>

<p>§ 77. The measures taken by the English proved effective,
for early in the next year, 894 (895), want of provisions
forced the Danes to evacuate Chester, and withdraw into
Wales, whence they retired to Mersea in Essex; ‘marching
through Northumbria and East Anglia, so as the fyrd
might not reach them<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>’; words which give eloquent
testimony to the changed state of things. At Mersea they
were joined by the fleet from Exeter, which had been beaten
off with heavy loss in an attempt which they had made on
Chichester. At the end of this year and the beginning of
the next, 895 (896), the Danes drew their ships up the
Thames and Lea to a spot twenty miles above London,
and there fortified themselves. An attempt by the garrison
of London with other forces to storm the Danish lines
failed; and so during harvest Alfred encamped in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
neighbourhood to protect the inhabitants of the district,
while they were reaping their corn. One day as he was
riding up the river, he noticed a spot where it seemed to
him possible, by constructing obstacles on either side of the
stream, to prevent the Danish ships from getting out<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>.
He at once proceeded to put his plan into execution, but
he had hardly begun when the Danes realised that they
were out-manœuvred, and abandoning their ships once
more struck off for the upper waters of the Severn. The
fyrd pursued, but here again no attempt was made to
blockade them, and the Danes wintered at Bridgenorth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Break-up
of the
Danish
host.</div>

<p>The next summer, 896 (897), the Danish host broke up,
‘some to East Anglia, some to Northumbria. Those who
had no property [in England] got them ships and fared
south over sea to the Seine.’ The long campaign was
over. ‘And through God’s mercy,’ says the Chronicler once
more, ‘the [Danish] host had not wholly ruined the
Angle-kin, but they were much more ruined in those three
years with murrain of men and cattle, and with the loss
of many of the most excellent king’s thanes who passed
away in those three years.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
new
ships. Not a
great
success. Alfred’s
claim to
be the
founder
of the
English
navy
doubtful. Earlier

engagement.</div>

<p>§ 78. The only thing that remained to be done was to
suppress the predatory raids of Northumbrian and East
Anglian ships on the south coasts of Wessex. With this
object Alfred turned the constructive ability which he undoubtedly
possessed to the building of a new type of ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
just as Caesar did when he invaded Britain<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>. They were
much larger in all their measurements than the wiking
vessels, built neither on Frisian nor Danish lines, but
according to the king’s own ideas. To tell the honest
truth, they do not seem to have been a great success. In
an engagement between nine of the new ships and six
wiking vessels in the neighbourhood of the Isle of Wight
all the English ships got aground, ‘very uncomfortably,’
as the Chronicler quaintly says, six on one side of the strait
and three on the other. Moreover at the end of the same
annal it is recorded: ‘and the same summer perished no
less than twenty ships on the South Coast, crews and all’;
so that the new ships do not seem to have been very capable
of weathering a storm. We have noticed earlier naval operations
of Alfred in the years 875, 877, 881 (882), 884 (885).
I am, however, inclined to think that both Alfred’s claims
to be called the founder of the English navy, and also the
previous disuse of the sea by the Saxons have been somewhat
exaggerated. The mention of Frisians as fighting
on the English side<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> in the naval engagement just referred
to, shows indeed that Alfred was glad to avail himself of
these skilled mariners, who had probably come over to
England in consequence of the wiking settlements in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Frisia<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>, just as the Danish descent on Wessex, in 878,
drove many West Saxons to take refuge on the Continent.
And Asser expressly mentions Frisians among those who
settled under Alfred’s rule<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. There was certainly a naval
engagement in 851, under Æthelwulf<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>, in which the English
were victorious, if not yet earlier in 833 and 840<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>. Still
it is no doubt true that there was no fleet capable of safeguarding
the English coasts. The silence of the Chronicle
as to any later attacks may indicate that this was effected
in Alfred’s later years. Unhappily, for the last four years
of Alfred’s reign the Chronicle is silent as to almost everything.
So the argument is at best precarious. The stress
laid on the description of Alfred’s new ships shows that he
saw in this the necessary completion of his work for the
defence of England; but did it really require such an
immense amount of genius to discern that, as the invaders
came by sea, it was desirable to stop them, if possible,
before they got to land?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The problems
of
peace.</div>

<p>§ 79. We are constantly being told that ‘Peace hath
her victories not less renowned than war.’ But the victories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of peace are worthy of double renown when they have to
be won, as in Alfred’s case, from the ashes left by an
exhausting war. For, as Alfred says himself, ‘throughout
all England everything was harried and burnt<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>.’</p>

<p>The most needful of the works of peace is, as men have
often learnt by bitter experience, to be prepared for war.
Not only the works of peace, but peace itself, are impossible
except under the guarantee of an adequate military and
naval force. We have said enough already of Alfred’s
efforts to reorganise his kingdom on this side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil
reorganisation. The shire
system. Legislation
not
very important
in early
times.</div>

<p>Much too would be needed in the way of civil reorganisation,
especially in the non-West-Saxon districts
which had been won from the Danes. And this fact is
probably the basis of the legend which makes Alfred the
inventor of shires, hundreds, and tithings<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. Indeed, in the
districts which previously had formed part of Mercia, it is
probable that the shire system was introduced for the first
time, either now or a little later. For, as Mr. Taylor has
pointed out<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>, whereas every existing shire division south
of the Thames is mentioned in the oldest MS. of the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle before the first change of hand at
the year 892, there is no mention of any Mercian shire in
any MS. of the Chronicle prior to 1000. Legislation too
would be required, though we must always remember that
legislation, as we understand it, played a very small part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in Anglo-Saxon times. The idea of a code or body of
statutes covering all departments of civil life was quite
foreign to their notions, and every attempt to explain the
existing Anglo-Saxon laws on any such hypothesis must
be a failure. Into the details of Alfred’s laws I do not
propose to enter. To do so with any profit would require
more space than I can afford, and a minuter knowledge of
the earlier and later laws than I can pretend to. Indeed,
I must confess that the study of the Anglo-Saxon laws
often reduces me to a state of mental chaos. I may know,
as a rule, the meaning of individual words; I can construe,
though not invariably, the separate sentences. But what
it all comes to is often a total mystery. The reason (apart
from my own shortcomings) is to be sought in the fact
alluded to above, that a very small part of Anglo-Saxon
life and institutions is to be found in the laws, which imply
a whole body of unwritten custom, of which only the most
salient changes are registered in the laws. And as this
body of unwritten custom is, to a large extent, beyond our
reach, it is not surprising that the written law, to which it
was the key, should often be obscure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
laws
probably
passed
late in his
reign.</div>

<p>§ 80. The date of Alfred’s laws is unfortunately nowhere
given. But it must be comparatively late in his reign.
The introduction consists, as is well known, largely of
passages taken from the Old and New Testaments, translated
from the Vulgate with a degree of skill and freedom,
which seems to imply some practice in the work of translation
and adaptation, which, as we shall see, Alfred probably
did not begin at any rate before the year 887<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>. We may
therefore conjecture that the enactment of these laws should
be placed either just before, or just after the last great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
struggle with the Danes, 892-6; for William of Malmesbury’s
statement that while, as a rule, ‘inter arma silent
leges,’ Alfred carried on his legislation amid the din of
war<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>, need not be taken for more than the rhetorical
flourish which it evidently is.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Points of
interest
connected
with
them.</div>

<p>One or two points in the preface and in the laws may
just be briefly noted. In the former there is an interesting
mistranslation of the fifth commandment, the feminine
relative in the last clause: ‘which the Lord thy God
giveth thee,’ being taken to refer not to land (terra) but
to mother (matrem); ‘honour thy father and thy mother
whom the Lord gave thee<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>.’ Was it the thankful thought
of his own noble mother Osburh which prompted this
mistake?</p>

of a deposit, of the case of its having been captured
by the enemy<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>, throws light on the circumstances of the
time, as does the provision of one of the laws that, for
certain offences, the punishment is doubled when the ‘fyrd’
is out<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>. Characteristic too of the times is the fact that
treason against the lord is ‘boot-less<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>,’ i.e. incapable of
being atoned for by money-payment, and the provision
against harbouring the king’s fugitives<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>. Nor is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
surprising that Alfred the truth-teller should be specially
severe against falsehood; if any man commits folk-leasing,
i.e. public slander, he is to suffer no lighter punishment than
the loss of the offending member<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the Apostolic letter, which Alfred translates
from Acts xv, is found a version of the golden rule in its
negative form, ‘that which ye would not that other men
should do to you, do not ye to other men<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>.’ This is not, as
is often alleged<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>, an insertion made by Alfred from the
Sermon on the Mount<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>, but is an addition to the text of
Acts, found in some Greek and Old Latin MSS., from the
latter of which it passed into some MSS. of the Vulgate<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.
Most characteristic of Alfred’s thought is the comment:
‘by this one law any one may know how he ought to judge
another; he needs no other law book.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
administration
of
justice.</div>

<p>§ 81. Asser gives a striking picture<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>, which there is no
reason to distrust, of the pains which Alfred took to secure
a good administration of justice, and especially to ‘see that
such as are in need and necessity have right.’ From this
point of view we can understand Alfred’s recasting the
precept of Exodus xxiii. 3: ‘pauperis quoque non misereberis
in iudicio,’ ‘neither shalt thou favour a poor man in
his cause’ (R.V.). The warning that justice is no more to
be wrested in favour of the poor, than of the rich, is one
not unneeded now. But undue favouring of the poor was
a remote danger in Alfred’s day, when, as Asser says, the
poor had few helpers, or none, besides the king<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>. And so
Alfred puts the precept in a general form: ‘Judge thou
very equally, judge not one judgement for the rich, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
another for the poor<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>.’ And it would seem from Asser’s
account that he kept a control on the local administration
of justice, not only by constantly hearing appeals himself,
but also by a system of special envoys analogous to the
Carolingian ‘missi dominici,’ and to the later ‘justices in
eyre<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
accessibility
to
suitors.</div>

<p>Of Alfred’s accessibility as the fountain of justice a very
pleasant picture is given in a document addressed to Edward
the Elder detailing the progress of a suit which had come
before his father Alfred: ‘we went in to the king and told
him how we proposed to settle the matter, and the king
stood and washed his hands at Wardour within the bower,
and when he had finished, he asked us<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>,’ and so forth. It
reminds us of the sketch which Josephus gives of Philip,
tetrarch of Ituraea, almost the only amiable member of the
odious Herod family; how he would stroll through his
little state, with a chariot following him on which was
his curule chair, and if any of his subjects approached him
with their causes, he would at once have the chair brought
forward, and sit and give his judgement there and then<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>.
It reminds us still more of the great Charles, of whom
Einhard relates: ‘When he was putting on his shoes or
dressing, he would not only admit his friends, but also, if
the Count of the Palace reported that there was some suit
which could not be settled without his command, he would
have the parties brought in at once, and, as if sitting in
his tribunal, would hear the matter, and give his decision<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>.’
The satisfaction given by Alfred’s decisions appears not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
only from Asser’s panegyric, but also from the document
already cited, where the writer continues: ‘And, sire, if
every judgement which King Alfred gave is to be upset,
when shall we come to any conclusion?’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
laws

from

sources. Action

<p>§ 82. The last section of the Preface to the Laws which
tells how Alfred gathered these laws from older sources,
and rejected others, with the advice of his Witan, not
daring to add to them many of his own, which might
not be suitable to after ages<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>, has been often quoted as
an illustration of Alfred’s wise conservatism. It is also
the best illustration that we have of the action of the
Witenagemót in his reign. Others may be found in the
charters, but charters, as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>, are not numerous.
The most interesting illustration is to be found in Alfred’s
will, which shows how anxious Alfred was not to bring
any undue influence to bear upon his councillors. The will
tells us how in a Witenagemót at Long Dean<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> the provisions
of Æthelwulf’s will and the agreements made
between Alfred and his brothers were recited, in order
that the Witan might judge whether Alfred’s proposed
disposition of his property was in harmony with these:
‘Then prayed I them all for my love, and gave them my
pledge, that I would never bear any grudge against any
for what they might conscientiously decide, and that none
for love or fear of me should hesitate to declare the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the case<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>.’ The Chronicle does not mention a single
meeting of the Witan; and though it would be wrong to
argue from this silence, for the same is true of many other
reigns, yet it is probable that the circumstances of the time,
combined with Alfred’s character and ability, would tend to
throw more power into the hands of the king, and to reduce
proportionally the importance of the Witenagemót<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obscurity
of ecclesiastical
history
under
Alfred. Alfred’s
relation
to the
Church.</div>

<p>§ 83. Of synods or special ecclesiastical legislation I can
find no trace under Alfred. More than one bishop’s see
became temporarily or permanently extinct owing to the
ravages of the Danes<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>. The monasteries ‘once filled,’ as
Alfred says, ‘with treasures and books<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>’ were favourite
objects of attack. In the Preface to the Cura Pastoralis
Alfred thanks God for ‘the learned bishops which we now
have’; but, with the exception of the two archbishops
of Canterbury, Æthelred and Plegmund, Werferth of
Worcester, and Asser, it is hard to say anything about
any of them. It is the same with the abbots. Thorne,
the historian of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, gives a list
of abbots about this time, but he can say nothing as to
any of them<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. Beyond the broad fact of the ruin caused
by the ravages of the Danes, the whole history of the
Church under Alfred is most obscure<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>. This does not
mean that there is any truth in Ailred of Rievaulx’ myth<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
that Alfred regained it as a king’s chief dignity to have
no power in the Churches of Christ. What little evidence
there is points distinctly the other way<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. There is a curious
letter of Pope John VIII to Archbishop Æthelred<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
he says: ‘We admonish you to set yourself as a wall for
the house of God not only against the king, but also against
all who are minded to act perversely.’ There seems some
ground for Sir John Spelman’s remark: ‘The life and
ways of Alfred were not perfectly pleasing to the Fathers
of Rome<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>.’ A letter, from Archbishop Fulk of Rheims to
Æthelred’s successor, Plegmund<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>, shows that clerical and
episcopal marriages were common in England at that time;
and there are traces of something like hereditary succession
to ecclesiastical lands<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>. There is no evidence that Alfred
attempted to alter this state of things; there is some
evidence that he disapproved it. In the Soliloquies of
St. Augustine, the Anglo-Saxon translation of which<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> is
almost certainly by Alfred<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>, there is a passage in which
Augustine declares that he has no desire to marry. This,
which in the original is purely personal to Augustine, is by
the translator extended to all clergy: ‘I say however that
it is better for priests not to marry than to marry<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline
of monasticism.</div>

<p>Alfred made some attempt to revive the monastic life in
England. He built a monastery for men at Athelney<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>, no
doubt as a thank-offering for the deliverance there begun,
and a convent for women at Shaftesbury<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>; he also made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
arrangements, though he did not live to carry them out,
for founding the New Minster at Winchester<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>. But he
had but small success. The taste for the monastic life had
almost been extinguished among men in England; and of
the two contradictory causes which Asser suggests<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> for
this fact, viz. the Danish ravages, and the too great riches
of the English, which caused them to despise the monastic
life, there can be no doubt that the former is nearer the
truth. Alfred had accordingly to fill his monasteries with
foreign monks. The result was not always satisfactory, if
there is any truth in Asser’s story<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> how two of these foreign
monks at Athelney tried to murder their abbot, John
the Old Saxon. Besides his own foundations, Alfred was
a liberal contributor to other monasteries, not only in
England, but also in Ireland and on the Continent<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>. Yet
there is no monastic halo round the head of Alfred, like
that which adorns his great-grandson Edgar.</p>

<p>§ 84. That Alfred would be a careful and exact steward
of all the resources of his kingdom, we may assume without
any proof. But, for my own part, I wholly and entirely
distrust the account which Asser gives<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> of the minute and
mathematical divisions and subdivisions of revenue instituted
by Alfred. I regard it as an indication that at this
point of his work Asser was attacked by an acute fit of
imagination<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>. Dr. Stubbs has said that there is no point
on which we are more in the dark than on the financial
system of the Anglo-Saxons<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. We must also remember
that since so much of the revenue of an Anglo-Saxon king
was payable in kind, there was much less room for finance,
in the strict sense of the word, than in more modern states.</p>

<p>Of Alfred’s interest and skill in mechanical and artistic
inventions enough has perhaps been said already<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. Under
this head would come the well-known story of the candles
and the lantern shades<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>. I cannot myself go into raptures
over this, as some writers profess to do. But the mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of tents<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> in connexion with this invention, may perhaps
indicate that it was specially during campaigns that the
need of some such contrivance would be felt. It is one of
the many curious parallels between things English and
Frankish, that Pope Paul I sent to Pippin, the father of
Charles the Great, an instrument for showing the time at
night<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intercourse
with
other
nations. Ireland. Irish love of pilgrimage.</div>

<p>§ 85. Of Alfred’s intercourse with foreign nations Asser<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
gives a ‘heightened and telling’ picture, speaking of ‘daily
embassies of nations who dwell from the Tyrrhene Sea to
the furthest bound of Ireland.’ Of relations of Alfred
with the Irish princes<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> I have found no evidence. But an
interesting and pathetic instance of accidental intercourse
with Ireland is given in the Chronicle under 891: ‘In this
year three “Scots” (i.e. Irishmen) came to Alfred king, on
a boat without oars or rudder. They had stolen away
from Ireland, because they would be for God’s love on
pilgrimage, they recked not where. The boat on which
they fared was wrought of two and a half hides, and they
took with them meat for a sevennight. And at the end
of a sevennight they came to land in Cornwall, and straightway
fared to Alfred king. Thus were they named, Dubslane,
and Macbeth, and Maelinmain.’ The story is most
genuine, and redolent through and through of the spirit
of Irish History and Saga. The love of pilgrimage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
became a passion in the Irish Church<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>; the Irish Sagas
and the lives of the Irish Saints furnish many illustrations
of this desire for exile, this self-abandonment (as
they deemed it) to the will of God involved in committing
themselves to the deep in a frail skin-covered coracle without
oarage or steerage, the slender provision of food for
the voyage. In the Book of Leinster is a story how three
young Irish clerics set out on a pilgrimage; ‘they took
as provision on the sea only three loaves. “In the name
of Christ” (said they), “let us throw our oars into the
sea, and let us commend ourselves to our Lord.”’ So
in the voyage of Maelduin, the Irish Saga so well known
to English readers through Tennyson’s poem, Maelduin
and his companions exclaim: ‘leave the boat alone, and
cease rowing; whither God wills it to be borne, He will
bear it<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>.’ According to Ethelwerd<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>, these ‘Scots’ after
leaving Alfred went on to Rome and Jerusalem; and if so,
it may well be that this was one of the channels whereby
Alfred communicated with the East; for we have seen<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>
that Alfred’s intercourse with Elias III, patriarch of
Jerusalem, rests on very good evidence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ninth

<p>§ 86. It so happens that we have an account<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> of a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem, made just twenty-five years earlier,
by a Frankish monk named Bernard, who, with two companions,
a Spanish and an Italian monk, set out from
Rome about the year 865 with the blessing of Pope Nicholas
(c. 1). From Rome they went to Bari, then ‘a city of the
Saracens,’ from the ‘sultan’ of which they obtained letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to the rulers of Alexandria and Egyptian Babylon, i.e. Old
Cairo (c. 3). From Bari they walked to Taranto, where
they found six ships proceeding to Alexandria with a cargo
of 9,000 Christian captives from Beneventum (c. 4). The
admiral refused, however, to let them land, until they had
paid a ransom of six ‘aurei’ (c. 5). And when they presented
the letters of the sultan of Bari to the governour
of Alexandria they helped them not a whit; and only on
paying thirteen ‘denarii’<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> apiece were they sent on by
water with letters to the governour of Cairo (c. 6). Here
the same fate awaited them. In spite of all their letters
they were thrown into prison, but on payment of another
thirteen ‘denarii’ per head they were released, and furnished
with letters which did really prove effective, though
they had to get them sealed, or, as we should say, they
had to have their passports visaed in every town which
they passed through, and this meant ever fresh exactions
(c. 7). From Cairo they turned north by the Damietta
branch of the Nile and proceeded by Tanis (c. 8) to
Farama<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>, the traditional abode of the Holy Family, where
they procured camels on which they crossed the desert (c. 9)
to El Arisch, and so by Gaza, Ramleh, and Emmaus to
Jerusalem, where the patriarch was Theodosius, the immediate
predecessor of Alfred’s correspondent, Elias III.
Here they lodged in the hospice founded for pilgrims by
‘the glorious Emperor Charles,’ near which was the church
of St. Mary with a noble library of books, also given by
Charles (c. 10). After visiting the holy places (cc. 11-18),
they returned all the way by sea, having an unfavourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
passage of sixty days to Mont’ Auro (c. 19), whence they
returned to Rome, ‘where innumerable bodies of the saints
repose’ (c. 20). In some ways, apparently, a pilgrimage to
Rome was more dangerous than one to Jerusalem. There
is good peace, says the writer, between Christians and
pagans both in Egypt and Jerusalem, though they are
very strict on all travellers who have no passports (c. 22).
In Romagna, on the other hand, things were very bad,
and brigands so numerous, that pilgrims had to go in
bands and fully armed (c. 23).</p>

<p>I have thought it worth while to give an outline of this
most interesting little tract, because it shows us the route
taken, and the difficulties encountered, by a pilgrim to
Jerusalem in the reign of Alfred’s immediate predecessor<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>.</p>

<p>But Alfred’s messengers went further East than Palestine.
I have already quoted the passage from the Chronicle
which tells how in 883 Alfred sent alms to India to
St. Thomas and St. Bartholomew, in fulfilment of the vow
which he made ‘when they encamped against the Danes at
London.’ On the route taken by these messengers I can
unfortunately throw no light. But the entry is of transcendent
interest. It is the first recorded instance of a connexion
between England and Hindustan, a connexion
which has meant so much to India and to England; for it
is, I venture to think, to her government of India that
England largely owes the position in the world which she

<p>§ 87. But of all the objects which Alfred had in view
the one probably to which he attached most importance
was, in the words of our University bidding-prayer, ‘a
succession of persons duly qualified for the service of God
in Church and State.’ In a passage in the Consolation
of Philosophy<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Boethius says to his instructress: ‘Thou
knowest that ambition never was my mistress, though
I did desire materials for carrying out my task’; ‘which
task,’ adds Alfred, in his own words<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>, ‘was that I should
virtuously and fittingly administer the authority committed
to me. Now no man … can … administer government,
unless he have fit tools and the raw material to work upon.…
And a king’s raw material and instruments of rule are
a well-peopled land, and he must have men of prayer, men
of war, and men of work.… Without these tools he
cannot perform any of the tasks entrusted to him.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Court

<p>It was with a view to providing these necessary ‘tools,’

example of Charles the Great<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>, a Court school, for the
education specially of the sons of the upper classes, in
which books of both languages, Latin and Saxon, were
read, especially the Psalms and Saxon poems, and writing
also was taught; and to these studies the pupils applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
themselves, till they were old enough to learn ‘hunting
and other arts, befitting well-born men.’</p>

<p>This account of Asser<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> agrees well with the wish expressed
by Alfred in the Preface to the Pastoral Care,
‘That all the freeborn youth of England who have sufficient
means to devote themselves thereto, be set to learning so
long as they are not strong enough for any other occupation,
until such time as they can well read English writing.
Let those be taught Latin whom it is proposed to educate
further, and promote to higher office.’ This passage is
most interesting; but we must not, on the strength of it,
bring Alfred into court as an advocate either for or against
classical education. On the one hand Alfred clearly wished
that all who had the time and means should be taught
Latin; on the other hand Latin was then, as it is not now,
the sole vehicle of Western culture and science.</p>

<p>§ 88. But the great difficulty was to find teachers. Of
England, the part which had suffered least from the ravages
of the Danes was Western Mercia; moreover Offa had had
a real desire to promote learning in his kingdom, as Alcuin’s
letters show<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>; and from Mercia came Plegmund<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>, whom
Alfred ultimately made archbishop of Canterbury in succession
to Æthelred, Werferth, the faithful bishop of Worcester,
and two priests, Æthelstan and Werwulf, whom Alfred
made his chaplains. The fact that Asser applies to these
two last the term ‘sacerdotes,’ which, as I have elsewhere
shown, is ambiguous in mediaeval Latin, sometimes meaning
bishops, sometimes priests<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>, has led Roger of Wendover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
not only to convert these priests into bishops, but to give
them sees at Hereford and Leicester<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>; another illustration
of the way in which myths arise. From Wales Alfred got
Asser, as we have seen. But Britain alone could not supply
Alfred’s needs; and the Frankish empire was now to repay
to England some small portion of the debt which it owed
for Boniface and Alcuin, in the persons of Grimbald and
John the Old Saxon. Of the latter not much is known<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>.
He was a monk of Corvey, and was made by Alfred abbot
of his new monastery of Athelney. The story of his
attempted murder there has been already alluded to<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>. The
date of his coming to England is not known. The chronology
of Grimbald’s life is also very obscure. Mabillon
indeed was led to postulate two Grimbalds, who both
came to England under Alfred. But his perplexity was
largely caused by his acceptance of the Oxford interpolation
in Asser as genuine; and his solution is quite
incredible. Grimbald was a monk of St. Bertin’s in
Flanders. He held various offices in that monastery, and
in 892, on the death of Abbot Rudolf, the monks wished
him to become their abbot; but with a view of protecting
the monastery against the attacks of Count Baldwin of
Flanders, Fulk, archbishop of Rheims, who had been abbot
before Rudolf, was allowed to resume the abbacy, and hold
it with his archbishopric<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>. If all this is true, Grimbald
cannot have come to England much before 893, and as he
is mentioned in the Preface to the Pastoral Care as one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Alfred’s helpers in that work (along with Plegmund, Asser,
and John), it is obvious that this date for Grimbald’s
arrival in England, if it be regarded as established, will
have a very important bearing on the chronology of
Alfred’s writings<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>. There is a letter extant<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> which purports
to be Fulk of Rheims’ answer to Alfred’s application
for Grimbald. Certainly, if Fulk was holding the abbacy
of St. Bertin’s at this time, he would be the natural person
to give permission to a monk of that house to leave his
cloister<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>, and Dr. Stubbs thought that the MSS. in which
the letter is found were sufficiently ancient to exclude the
suspicion of forgery. Its authenticity has however been
doubted<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>, and I confess it presents one very great difficulty
to my mind. The letter throughout is written on the
assumption that Grimbald is to be a bishop in England;
he is to be placed over the care of pastoral rule, he is
already a priest, and is worthy of pontifical honour; if
Alfred will send Grimbald’s electors and certain leading
men in Church and State, Fulk will then ordain him (i.e.
as bishop, for he was already priest), and they can escort
him to his proper see<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>. Alfred is represented as having
stated in his application that, owing to the ravages of the
Danes, the lapse of time, the carelessness of prelates, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the ignorance of the people, ecclesiastical order had much
decayed in England<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>, which is true enough, whoever wrote
it. But there is no other evidence anywhere of any intention
of making Grimbald a bishop. Dean Hook’s idea<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>
that Alfred intended to make him archbishop of Canterbury,
but finding the appointment of a foreigner unpopular,
substituted Plegmund, has not a scrap of evidence to
support it; while if Grimbald did not come to England
till 893 the primacy had long been filled up. Ultimately
Grimbald was made abbot of the New Minster at Winchester,
where he died in 903, and became one of the
tutelary saints of that foundation, winning a place in the
English Calendar<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>. The tradition that Asser was one of
the embassy sent to escort Grimbald to England has been
already alluded to<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
translations; their
object.</div>

<p>§ 89. But it was not only by educational institutions
whether in Court or monastery that Alfred endeavoured to
raise the culture of his people. The art of translation,
which he had practised at first for his own instruction and
edification, he came afterwards to use in order to place
within reach of his people<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> the most useful works in
different branches of knowledge. The object which Alfred
had in view is clearly laid down in the oft-quoted Preface
to the Pastoral Care. After tracing the practical extinction
of the knowledge of Latin south of the Thames<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
made all the knowledge contained in that language inaccessible
to a degree which would have seemed inconceivable
to previous generations, he continues: ‘therefore
it seems to me best, if you agree<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>, that we should translate
some books, those namely which are most necessary
for all men to know, into the language which we all
understand.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story
how
Alfred
began to
translate. The
Handbook.</div>

<p>§ 90. The story how Alfred first began to combine
translation with reading<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> is told in a well-known passage
of Asser<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>. He relates how one day, while the king and
himself were reading and talking together, Alfred was
much struck by a passage in the work which Asser was
reading to him, and begged him to write it down for him
in the little book of psalms and prayers which he always
carried about with him. Asser suggested that it would be
better to start a separate book for such extracts, and went
and fetched a quire of parchment, and in course of time
the book of translated extracts grew, until it reached nearly
the size of a Psalter. Alfred called it his Encheiridion,
Manual, or Handbook<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>, because he always kept it close at
hand. This according to Asser took place in the year 887.</p>

<p>A great deal of unnecessary mystery has been made
about this Handbook. Asser’s account shows that it was
simply what we should call a commonplace book. In the
course of years Alfred may have made more than one such
commonplace book. The one started at Asser’s suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
contained, according to him, ‘flosculi diuinae scripturae’;
that is, probably, extracts from the Bible and the Fathers.
But other parts of the volume, or, it may be, a later volume
of the same kind, contained historical jottings; for William
of Malmesbury quotes Alfred’s Handbook as an authority
for the life of Aldhelm, citing Alfred’s high appreciation
of Aldhelm’s Saxon poems, and adding the beautiful
tradition how by his skill as a minstrel he would gather
the people round him, and gradually turn his song to
sacred themes<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>. Florence of Worcester<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> also cites a work
which he calls ‘Dicta regis Ælfredi’ as an authority on
the West Saxon genealogy. Even if we reject the evidence
of Malmesbury and Florence as being so much later than
Alfred’s time, it seems to me quite impossible to identify
a theological commonplace book, such as Asser describes,
with the translation of Augustine’s Soliloquies, as Wülker
was once inclined to do<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>, partly on the ground that Asser
applies the term ‘flosculi’ to the Handbook, while the
translation of the Soliloquies bears the title ‘Blostman’
or Blooms. But the latter work, however free in the way
in which it deals with its original, is very much more
than a book of extracts. Besides, according to Asser, the
Encheiridion was the very first of Alfred’s works, whereas
all critics are agreed that the Soliloquies are among the
last, probably the very last of his works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The translation
of
Gregory’s
Dialogues,
attributed
by Asser
to Werferth.</div>

<p>§ 91. Besides the Encheiridion, the only one of the
literary works which owed their origin to Alfred mentioned
by Asser is the translation of the Dialogues of Gregory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the Great<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>. The existence of the Chronicle, at any rate
up to 887, is implied in Asser’s use of it, but it is nowhere
mentioned. The easiest explanation of Asser’s silence as
to Alfred’s other works is that they did not then exist.
The date at which Asser professes to be writing is, as we
have seen, 894; and this in turn confirms the view derived
from the chronology of Grimbald’s life, as to the comparatively
late date at which Alfred commenced his independent
literary career.</p>

<p>According to Asser, the translation of the Dialogues was
not made by Alfred himself, but by Bishop Werferth at
his command<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>; and in the little preface which Alfred prefixes
to the work he makes no claim of authorship, but
merely says: ‘I besought my trusty friends that out of
God’s<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> books of the lives and miracles of the saints they
would write for me the instruction which follows, so that,
strengthened in my mind through memory and love, I may,
amid the troubles of this world, sometimes think on the
things of heaven.’ Whether the expression ‘trusty friends’
is merely an impersonal plural for Werferth, or whether
others really co-operated, I cannot say; but we may take
it that Werferth was mainly responsible, and that in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
case the share of Alfred was confined to furnishing a
preface; just as authors nowadays are glad to get some
man of light and leading to commend their works to the
public.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assistance
given to
Alfred
by his
literary
advisers.</div>

<p>The degree in which Alfred made use of the help of his
learned advisers would vary no doubt with the difficulty of
the work in hand, and the degree of the king’s own progress.
In the case of the Pastoral Care, Alfred himself has
told us who his helpers were<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>; in other cases, as we shall
see, interesting traditions have been preserved. But I
imagine that in all cases a good deal of the drudgery would
be done by others, Alfred supplying the final literary form.
Similar instances of co-operation have not been unknown in
Oxford in the nineteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of the
Dialogues
as to
Alfred’s
religious
thought.</div>

<p>§ 92. If any evidence were needed to show that Alfred,
with all his true and earnest piety, was yet in his religious
thought the child of his century, it would be found in the
fact that he should have chosen the Dialogues of Gregory
as the first of all books to be translated. The work was
enormously popular in the Middle Ages<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>; but to our
thought it is the least edifying of all Gregory’s writings.
In it the principle of St. James, that ‘the effectual fervent
prayer of a righteous man availeth much,’ is materialised,
until the prayers of the saints become a mere sort of
lucky bag or wishing cap for the obtaining of anything
that is wanted, from the raising of the dead, or the punishment
of an enemy, to the supply of the most ordinary
articles of domestic economy, such as oil, and wine, or the
mending of a broken sieve; while the fact that Gregory
professes in many cases to have these stories from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
mouth of eyewitnesses<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>, illustrates the truth of what
Dr. Gore has said<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>, that ‘there are … ages when belief is
so utterly uncritical, that it does seem as if they could not
under any circumstances afford us satisfactory evidence of
miraculous occurrences.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relics.</div>

<p>In this connexion may be mentioned the stress which
Asser lays on Alfred’s veneration for the relics of the
saints<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>. In this too, if it is authentic, Alfred was the
child of his age. The natural feeling of Christian reverence
for the body which had once been a temple of the Holy
Ghost, degenerated into an unhealthy passion for collecting
dead men’s bones, which reached its height in the ninth
century<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>. And this passion led to a hungry relic-mongering,
a system of pious thefts, and a wholesale manufacture
of spurious relics, of which Rome was the head-quarters,
which are among the least pleasant features of the mediaeval
Church. We may be sure that there was nothing unworthy
either in Alfred’s reverence for the relics, or in his belief in
the wonder-working powers of the saints. And for the
rest, I think one realises more and more how a really
religious spirit assimilates the good and is immune from
the evil of the particular system in which it is placed by
Providence. There is no one, for instance, who knows
anything of the lives of the devout peasantry, say, of
Scotland, or of Roman Catholic countries on the Continent,
but must feel that the somewhat hard creed of the one, and
the somewhat superstitious creed of the other are absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
as nothing compared with the effectual power of religion
which is the same in both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Double
recension
of the
translation
of the
Dialogues.</div>

<p>To return, however, from this digression to Werferth’s
translation of the Dialogues. One very interesting fact
about this translation is that, for the greater part of the
first two books<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>, it exists in two recensions, of which the
later is not an independent translation, but stands to
the older text in the relation of a revised version<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>. It
is, as a rule, much nearer to the original; it retrenches
the redundancies<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>, and corrects the mistakes<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> of the
earlier version. Sometimes we can see that the reviser had
a different reading in the Latin text from that adopted in
the unrevised translation<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>. Moreover the vocabulary is
considerably modified, certain words being systematically
substituted by the reviser for others of like meaning<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
This last feature makes it likely that the reviser was a
different person from the original translator. Who he was
we shall probably never know. It is unlikely to have been
Alfred himself. For the rest, both versions keep pretty
close to the original without substantial additions or
omissions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Anglo-Saxon
martyrology. The
Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle.</div>

<p>§ 93. In the class of works which owe their inspiration
to Alfred, though not actually written by him, we may
possibly place the Anglo-Saxon martyrology alluded to
above<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>. We may certainly place in this class the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> in its original form, and may inscribe
upon it the legend which encircles Alfred’s Jewel, ‘Alfred
bade make me.’ I have shown elsewhere that all the MSS.
of the Chronicle up to 892 are traceable to a common
original. From that point they diverge. The explanation
is that at that point copies were made<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> and sent to different
religious houses, where they were continued to a large
extent independently of one another. This view of Alfred’s
relation to the Chronicle is strongly confirmed by the
genealogical preface in MS. <img class="inline" src="images/a.jpg" width="20" height="20" alt="A" /> of the Chronicle, in which
the West Saxon genealogy is carried down to the accession
of Alfred and no further, showing clearly that it was drawn
up for a chronicle compiled in his reign.</p>

<p>Another fact which points the same way is the strong
resemblance between the phraseology of the Chronicle and
that of Alfred’s translation of Orosius, of which I shall
have more to say when I come to speak of that translation<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Gaimar also, as is well known, has a most interesting passage
in which he connects the composition of the Chronicle both
with Alfred and with Winchester. Of course Gaimar is a
very late authority. But his statement harmonises so well
with the indications furnished by the Chronicle itself, and
with the inherent probabilities of the case, that I am inclined
to attach much weight to it. Moreover the moderation
of Gaimar’s statement is distinctly in its favour. He
does not say that Alfred wrote the Chronicle, but merely
that he caused it to be written.</p>

<p>Of the materials available for carrying out Alfred’s
design for a national Chronicle I have said enough elsewhere.</p>

<p>§ 94. It may be convenient to mention here one or two

of those works as to the authenticity of which there is
practically no doubt.</p>

MS. Partly in

partly in
verse. Arguments

and
against Alfred’s
authorship

the prose
portion.</div>

<p>In William of Malmesbury’s account of Alfred’s literary
works there occurs this very interesting statement: ‘He
began to translate the Psalter, but died when he had barely
finished the first part of it<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>.’ By the first part is probably
meant the first fifty psalms. The Psalter was frequently
regarded in the Middle Ages as consisting of three divisions
of fifty psalms each; so much so, that one of the regular
names for the Psalter in Irish is ‘the three fifties<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>.’ Now
it is an interesting fact that in the Bibliothèque Nationale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
at Paris, there is an eleventh century MS. containing a
Latin and an Anglo-Saxon version of the psalms in parallel
columns<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>; each psalm, with one or two exceptions, being
headed by a Latin rubric, and, in the case of the first
fifty psalms, also by an explanation in Saxon of the
circumstances which gave rise to the psalm, and of the
applications of which it is susceptible. The MS. formerly
belonged to Jehan, Duc de Berry (1340-1416), the brother
of Charles V of France, who possibly acquired it during
his nine years’ sojourn as a hostage in England after the
peace of Brétigny, 1360. Now it is a striking fact that
in this Psalter the first fifty psalms are translated into
prose, while the remainder are in alliterative verse. The
question therefore arises, did the scribe of the MS. (or of
its archetype) take the latter part of an existing alliterative
version, in order to complete a fragmentary prose translation?
or did he, on the other hand, take part of an
existing prose translation to make good a copy of the
poetical version which had been accidentally mutilated at
the beginning? The former is, on every ground, more
probable; especially as we have evidence of the existence
of a complete alliterative version of the Psalter identical
with that in the Paris MS.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>, whereas there is no such
evidence available in the case of the fragmentary prose
version. It was therefore an attractive suggestion of
Professor Wülker’s<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> that in this fragment we have the
incomplete Alfredian version mentioned by William of
Malmesbury. The question has been elaborately discussed
on the affirmative side by Dr. Wichmann<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>, on the negative
side by Dr. J. Douglas Bruce<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. I cannot say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
arguments of either have carried any strong conviction to
my mind. Dr. Bruce’s reasoning that the translation and
headings imply a knowledge of ecclesiastical modes of interpretation
impossible to a layman, overlooks the possibility
that Alfred might derive that knowledge from his clerical
assistants. On the other hand I cannot attach much
weight to Dr. Wichmann’s arguments from coincidences
with the Cura Pastoralis, or from the applicability of
certain interpretations to the circumstances of Alfred’s life.
When we consider that David and Alfred were both kings,
that both had enemies from whom they were both very
marvellously delivered, we shall readily see that an interpretation
which would suit the one might very easily be
applicable to the other. The most striking instance of this
has not, as far as I remember, been cited. It is in the
introduction to Ps. xxiii (xxiv), where it is said that in this
psalm David was prophesying how his ealdormen (principes)
would be fain of his return from exile<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>, words which recall
the expression of the Chronicler how Alfred’s people ‘were
fain of him’ when he emerged from his retreat at
Athelney.</p>

<p>On the whole then we must leave the question undecided,
until further evidence or further argument is
brought forward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Even if

<p>§ 95. I would however point out that even if the
decision should be against Alfred’s authorship, it is still
possible that the prose portion of the Paris Psalter may be
the work referred to by William of Malmesbury. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
colophon at the end of the MS. gives the name of the
scribe in the Latin form Wulfwinus. In the Cottonian
Collection there is a MS. of the Saxon Gospels with
the colophon: ‘Wulfwi me wrat.’ This was certainly
a Malmesbury book, as is shown by the insertion of a
Malmesbury Charter between the Gospels of St. Luke
and St. John. If this Wulfwi could be identified with
the Wulfwinus of the Paris Psalter, or its archetype<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>, it
would make it likely that that also was a Malmesbury
book. William of Malmesbury was librarian of his
monastery<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>, and there may have been a tradition there
that the prose translation was the work of Alfred; a
tradition which would be interesting even if it were not
strictly true<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Statement
that

<p>There is a statement in the twelfth-century Liber

Testaments for the blessing of the English nation<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>.’ I
know no earlier evidence for this, and I believe the statement
to have arisen from a misunderstanding of one of
William of Malmesbury’s rhetorical flourishes in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
says that Alfred ‘gave to English ears the greater part of
the Roman library<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> (bibliothecae)’, meaning by the last
phrase Latin authors. But Bibliotheca is a common name
in the Middle Ages for St. Jerome’s Latin translation of
the Bible, the library of divine books<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>; hence Malmesbury’s
statement was misunderstood as meaning that Alfred
had translated the greater part of the Latin Bible.</p>

translation
of
Gregory’s
Pastoral
Care. Its relation
to the

and additions.</div>

<p>§ 96. Very different in value from the Dialogues, according
to our notions, is the other work of Gregory, the
translation of which is due to Alfred, the Pastoral Care.
It is a beautiful book, full of wise and loving spiritual
counsel, and of sayings both shrewd and tender. It is
greatly to the credit of the mediaeval Church that it set
such store by this little manual<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>. Alfred sent a copy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his translation to each of his bishops, to aid them in what
Gregory himself<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> so beautifully calls ‘the art of arts, the
care of souls.’ I agree with Professor Wülker<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> in thinking
this the earliest of Alfred’s translations, and largely for
the reason that, as he points out, the Preface, as we have
learnt to know it, is so obviously a preface, not merely to
this work, but to the whole series of translations which
Alfred contemplated, of ‘the books which it is most
needful for every man to know.’ If what was said above
is correct, the date of it cannot be earlier than 894, and
it may be a little later. It has often been noticed that
of all Alfred’s works (not reckoning among these the
Dialogues), this is the one in which he keeps closest to
his original. I attribute this rather to his reverence for
that original, than to any inability on his part to deal
more freely with it, had he so desired. The omissions are
few and unimportant<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>. The additions are much more
numerous, but as a rule they are very slight. They are
mostly of the kind which a modern editor would place on
the margin or in a footnote. A very large class consists
merely of the insertion of the names of the various books
of the Bible from which Gregory’s scriptural quotations
are taken<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>. In the case of the psalms the number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
psalm is often given<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>, which is possibly an illustration of
Asser’s statements<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> as to the special fondness of Alfred
for the Psalter. Other insertions consist of brief explanatory
notes; an allusion or metaphor is cleared up<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>,
a foreign word or custom is explained<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>, a quotation or
story is completed<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. Thus after a reference to the institution
of the Levirate among the Jews, Alfred adds: ‘this
was good law under the old covenant, and to us now it
is a parable<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>.’ The manna is ‘the sweet food that came
down from heaven<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>.’ Shittim wood, we are told, never
rots<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>. It does not follow that the explanation is always
correct. Thus to Christ’s denunciation of the Pharisees
for scrupulosity in tithing herbs is added the statement
that they left untithed their more valuable possessions<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.</p>

<p>§ 97. Occasionally Alfred interprets biblical things by
Saxon analogies. Thus the Hebrew cities of refuge become
a Saxon ‘frithstow<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>,’ as they do also in Alfred’s preface
to his laws<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>. The Doctors among whom the child Jesus
was found were the wisest ‘Witan’ that there were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Jerusalem<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>. Uriah, whom David murdered, was ‘his
own loyal thane<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>.’ In the Soliloquies Alfred speaks of
the Apostles as Christ’s thanes<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>. This process is carried
yet further in the sacred epic poetry both of the insular
and continental Saxons, the disciples becoming Christ’s
‘comites’ or ‘gesiths,’ who are bound to die with their Lord<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.
Alfred here also, as in some of his other works<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>, and in the
Laws<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>, lays great stress on the position of the Lord<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>. Once
or twice Alfred tones down his original; thus where Gregory
speaking of the death of impenitent sinners says: ‘they
lament that they refused to serve God now that they can
in no wise by service make good the evils of their former
negligence,’ Alfred in his pity inserts the clause: ‘unless
they be helped by repentance and God’s mercy<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>.’ In one
instance the explanation given is dogmatic, the reception
of ‘the spirit of adoption’ of which St. Paul speaks, being
referred to baptism<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>. No doubt for many, if not most,
of these additions Alfred was indebted to his clerical
assistants. Often, without any very distinct addition
being made to the text, it is rather freely expanded<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>.
Sometimes the rendering is rather loose<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>, as if the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of the original had been imperfectly grasped; sometimes
it is distinctly wrong<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>. And throughout one may
say that the translation is made (to use Alfred’s own
expression) rather ‘sense by sense’ than ‘word by word<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>.’
And sometimes, though the phrase may be very close to
the original, it seems to bear the stamp of Alfred’s own
experience. The heading of the fourth chapter must have
come straight from his heart: ‘that many times the
business of government and rule distracts the mind of
the ruler<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>.’ ‘What,’ he exclaims in another place, ‘is
rule and authority but the soul’s tempest which is always
buffeting the ship of the heart with the storms of many
thoughts, so that it is driven hither and thither in very
narrow straits, wellnigh wrecked among many mighty
rocks<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>?’ Or again: ‘the patient must be admonished to
strengthen their heart after their great victory, and hold
the burg of their mind against marauding bands, and
fortify it with battlements<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>.’ Lastly: ‘every host (<i>here</i>)
is the less effective when it comes, if its coming is known
beforehand. For it finds them prepared whom it thought
to take unprepared<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>.’ In these two last passages we seem
almost to hear the echo of Alfred’s experience in 878<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Question as to the
order of
the
Orosius
and Bede
translations.</div>

<p>§ 98. The next two works of Alfred to be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
are both historical, viz. the translations of Orosius’ Universal
History, and of Bede’s Ecclesiastical History of the
English Nation. There has been however considerable
difference of opinion as to the order of these two works.
The earlier critics, however much they might differ among
themselves as to the succession of Alfred’s works taken as
a whole, all, with the exception of Dr. Bosworth, agreed
in placing the Orosius before the Bede<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>. But in recent
times Wülker<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>, August Schmidt<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>, and my friend Professor
Schipper of Vienna<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> have argued in favour of the other
view. The chief ground on which they have based their
conclusion is the greater freedom of the Orosius both in
translation and arrangement as compared with the Bede.
In the latter the translation is sometimes quite unduly
literal, so as to be almost unintelligible in places without
a reference to the original<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>; while as to arrangement, the
modifications of the original are, for the most part, limited
to omissions of matters like the Easter Controversy which
had ceased to have any living interest, the additions and
transpositions being very unimportant. The Orosius on the
other hand is not only freer in translation, but is so recast
by transposition, addition, and omission, as to be practically
a new work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the two
originals, and of the
translations.</div>

<p>It is argued that this greater freedom implies a more
practised hand, and therefore a later date. The argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
seems to me fallacious. As regards substantial alterations
we must bear in mind the different character of the two
originals. Bede’s Ecclesiastical History has always been an
almost sacred book to Englishmen. It needed no recasting,
beyond a few omissions, to make it suitable for English
readers in Alfred’s day. But Orosius’ work, written with the
polemical object of enforcing the argument of Augustine’s De
Ciuitate Dei against the pagan contention that the troubles
of the times were due to the introduction of Christianity,
by showing, in a survey of universal history, that the evils
of pre-Christian days were far greater, and full therefore
of ecclesiastical gloating over the crimes and calamities of
pagan history, required much more drastic treatment. On
the occasional over-literalness of the Bede translation I shall
have something to say presently. As regards the greater
freedom of the Orosius, any one who has examined in one
of our Pass Schools will bear witness that there is a kind of
free translation, which is very far from implying a perfect
mastery of the original. And I must confess that
Alfred’s freedom in the Orosius is often of the latter kind<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>.
I should say that there are far more serious blunders in
translation in the Orosius than in the Bede; though on
the other hand it must be remembered that Bede’s Latin
is a good deal easier than that of Orosius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arguments
in
favour of
the priority
of
the
Orosius. Argument
on the
other
side.</div>

<p>§ 99. In the Introduction to the second volume of my
Saxon Chronicle<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> I argued in favour of the priority of
the Orosius, on the ground of the affinity in diction and
expression between it and the Saxon Chronicle. That
argument I need not repeat here; I still think that it has
force, though I possibly laid too much stress upon it, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
one is apt to do when one gets hold of an idea which one
fancies to be new<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>. It is however capable of being
reinforced. The second chapter of Bede’s first book contains
an account of Caesar’s invasions of Britain. This is
a matter which one would take to be of great interest to
all inhabitants of this island<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>. Yet in the Bede translation
it is, in the older recension, omitted altogether, and
even in the later recension is passed over with the barest
mention<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>. But this chapter is almost wholly taken from
Orosius; and when we turn to the Orosius version, we
find that Alfred has not only translated the passage in
question, but has enriched it with his own local knowledge,
telling us that Caesar’s first two engagements with the
natives were ‘in the land which is called Kent-land,’ and
that the third took place ‘near the ford which is called
Wallingford<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>.’ If the Orosius translation preceded the
Bede, we can understand why Alfred omitted the corresponding
passage in the latter. Again, in chapter v of
the same book, Bede expressly corrects a mistake of
Orosius’ as to the wall of Severus, saying that it was
not properly a wall, but a rampart of sods with a ditch;
Alfred not only adopts this correction here<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>, but in
another place of the Bede seems to emphasise it<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
there is no special emphasis in the original. In the
Orosius passage the mistake is uncorrected<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>. Alfred shows
in many ways that he had a good memory, and that he
did not shrink from correcting his authors where he
thought they needed it; he would hardly have ignored
Bede’s correction had he been cognisant of it when he
was making the translation of Orosius. The only serious
argument on the other side is one which has not, as far
as I am aware, been previously noticed. I mean the
affinity of passages in the Orosius with passages in the
Boethius, which is, as we shall see<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>, almost certainly later
than either the Orosius or the Bede. Of these the most
important are two in which Alfred without any hint from
the original protests against the doctrine that all things
happen by fate<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>, a subject which occupies a prominent
place in the Boethius. There would, however, be nothing
impossible in the supposition that Alfred may have read the
Consolation of Boethius before he undertook the work of
translating it, or the subject may have been suggested
to his active mind in some other way. On the whole the
question of precedence as between the Orosius and the
Bede must be left uncertain; though in accordance with
my own view I shall take the Orosius first.</p>

<p>§ 100. It would be impossible to discuss in detail the
modifications made by Alfred in his original. They occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
on almost every page. I can only indicate their general
character, and give a few specimens of some of the more
important. And in doing this I very willingly acknowledge
the help which I have derived from Dr. Hugo
Schilling’s useful dissertation on the subject<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Additions. Voyages
of Ohthere
and
Wulfstan.</div>

<p>It may give some measure of the extent of Alfred’s
changes to note that whereas the original consists of seven
books divided into 236 chapters, the Saxon version contains
six books with only 84 chapters<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>. The most important
additions are to be found in the geographical introduction
which Orosius prefixes to his work. It is here that Alfred
inserts the well-known description of the geography of
Germany, which for him includes all central Europe from
the Rhine on the west to the Don on the east, and from
the Danube on the south to the White Sea on the north<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>.
Here too are inserted the yet more famous accounts of the
voyages of Ohthere<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> and Wulfstan<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>, on which so much
has been written. Ohthere’s account begins: ‘Ohthere
told his lord king Alfred that of all the Northmen he
dwelt furthest to the North’; and this is the only direct
evidence which the work contains as to its authorship.
These accounts and also the description of Germany, which,
like them, must have been carefully derived from oral
information, illustrate what Asser tells of Alfred’s intercourse
with strangers and his eagerness to learn from
them<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>, a trait which was characteristic also of the great

the description of a Roman triumph<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>, and of the temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of Janus<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>. But there are endless smaller additions; and
of these one of the most interesting is the anecdote,
ultimately derived from Suetonius, how Titus used to say
that the day was a lost day on which he had done no good
to any one<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>. This saying is quoted also in the Chronicle,
and is one of the links connecting the two works<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>. We
can understand how this saying of the ‘deliciae generis
humani’ would come home to the heart of England’s
darling<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>. Some of these shorter insertions are brief
explanatory notes<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> like those which we have already met
with in the Cura Pastoralis, and, like them, are by no
means always correct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Editorial
explanations.</div>

<p>§ 101. Sometimes the explanations are longer; and
many of these are due entirely to Alfred’s imagination,
and are intended to make clear to us how, in his view, the
event narrated came about. It is not in accordance with
our modern notions that editorial explanations of this kind
should be incorporated in the text of an author. But the
idea of literary property is a comparatively modern one,
and footnotes and appendices had not then been invented.
It is more questionable when the phrase ‘cwæð Orosius’
which Alfred frequently<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> uses to indicate that a sentiment
or a statement is his author’s, not his own, is used, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the case in one or two instances, to introduce something
for which there is no warrant in the original; for instance,
one of the passages about fate alluded to above<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These frequently
relate to
military
matters.</div>

<p>Of these editorial explanations the most interesting
perhaps are those which relate to military matters;
because they seem in some cases to reflect Alfred’s own
military experience—a point which Schilling has not
noticed. For instance, when Alfred gives as Hannibal’s
reason for his terrible winter march over the Apennines,
that ‘he knew that Flaminius the consul was fancying
that he might remain securely in his winter quarters, …
being fully persuaded that no one would attempt such
a march by reason of the intense cold<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>,’ we think of the
sudden swoop of the Danes on Alfred at Chippenham that
Epiphany tide 878<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>; the stratagem of a simulated flight,
by which he explains the defeat of Regulus<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>, is one which
there is reason to believe that the Danes more than once
resorted to<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>; as also the device which he attributes to
Hannibal, without any warrant from the original text,
of sending out parties to ravage in various directions in
order to make the enemy imagine that his whole force
was occupied in this manner<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>; though this also closely
resembles the feigned attacks which Alfred himself made
from Athelney, in order to mask his advance in force to
Ethandun<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Passages

<p>§ 102. The same is true of some things for which there
is a basis in Orosius himself; for instance, the story how,
within sixty days from the felling of the trees, Duilius had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a fleet of 130 ships ready ‘both with mast and sail<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>’
recalls Alfred’s own shipbuilding efforts; the story how
Dercyllidas dealt with the opposing forces of Pharnabazus
and Tissaphernes is extraordinarily like Alfred’s attempt
to detach the Danes of Milton from those at Appledore in
893 [894]<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>: ‘As soon as the Lacedemonian general knew
that he had to deal with two hosts (<i>heras</i>), he thought it
more advisable to make peace with the one, in order that
he might the more easily overcome the other<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>’; while
I have already suggested that the twofold division of the
Amazonian host<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>, one to remain at home while the other
was on active service, may have even suggested Alfred’s
similar division of the native fyrd <i>or</i> militia. And, indeed,
if the workings of the human mind were always traceable,
I fancy we should find, more often than is commonly
supposed, that what seem like brilliant intuitions on the
part of great commanders and statesmen, had really been
suggested by their reading. Nor is this any detraction
from their originality. To remember at the right time,
and apply in the right way, the hints furnished by previous
experience, is as much a mark of genius as invention.
There is an interesting tradition that Nelson’s manœuvre
of anchoring his vessels by the stern at the bombardment
of Copenhagen in 1801, was suggested by the fact that he
had that morning been reading the twenty-seventh chapter
of the Acts, which tells how St. Paul’s shipwrecked companions
‘cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for
the day<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>.’</p>

Alfred’s own sentiments; his religious feelings<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>, his

The omissions are often dictated by similar motives. He
leaves out or abridges many of the civil wars, the calamities,
the crimes, the unclean mythologies<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>, over which Orosius
gloated as proofs of heathen depravity; though often the
omissions have no special motive beyond the necessity for
shortening the work. It must be confessed that these
omissions frequently have the effect of wholly dislocating
the succession of events. And it may be said generally
that Alfred, though he apprehends individual incidents
with extraordinary vividness, is by no means clear as to
the connexion of events. For the latter quality greater
knowledge was required than was accessible in his day.
In regard to the additions, moreover, we must bear in
mind the possibility that some of them may be due, not
to Alfred himself, but to interpolations or glosses in the
MSS. which he used. This, as we shall see<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>, is a consideration
of great importance in the case of the Boethius,
but it has been proved to apply to one or two passages
of the Orosius also<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>. That there are many errors as to
persons bearing the same or similar names<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>, many confusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of personal and geographical appellations<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>, many
quaint mistakes of translation<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> and of fact, as when he
says that Augustus took his name from the eighth month
of the year instead of vice versa<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>, turns the snake-charming
tribe of Psylli<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> into a kind of serpent, and infers from
Augustus’ heart-broken exclamation, ‘Vare, redde legiones,’
that that ill-fated commander had escaped alive from his
defeat<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>; this is only what we might expect, and it would
be ungracious to dwell upon such things<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>. Dr. Schilling
has truly and excellently said<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> of the Orosius: ‘We see
Alfred here weak in historical and linguistic knowledge;
but we see him also simple, high-hearted, and earnest;
full of warm appreciation for all that is good, and of
scorn for all that is evil; putting himself to school that he
may educate and raise his people.’</p>

<p>§ 104. We have seen<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> that in the case of the Orosius,
the only direct hint of authorship contained in the book
itself is the address of Ohthere to ‘his lord King Alfred’;
and the earliest external testimony on the subject is to be
found in William of Malmesbury in the early part of the
twelfth century. But no one has ever doubted King
Alfred’s authorship. Till recently the same might have
been said of the Bede; in 1877 Professor Wülker spoke of
Alfred’s authorship of the Bede as ‘a fact which no one
hitherto has doubted or could doubt<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>.’ Since then, however,
Mr. Sweet, in his Anglo-Saxon Reader<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>, and Dr. Thomas
Miller in his edition of the Bede translation, published by
the Early English Text Society<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>, have tried to overthrow
the traditional view; the former, mainly on the ground
of that occasional over-literalness of the version already
alluded to<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>; the latter, because he thinks that it shows
Mercian characteristics incompatible with a West Saxon
origin. Now we must admit at once that the book itself
contains no direct evidence of authorship, not even such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a hint as is dropped in the Orosius. On the other hand
the external evidence is very much earlier. Ælfric, the
homilist, distinctly quotes the book as Alfred’s. In his
homily on St. Gregory he says: ‘Many books tell of his
conversation and holy life, as does Historia Anglorum,
which King Alfred translated out of English into Latin.…
We will however tell you something about him
because the fore-said book is not known to all of you,
although it is translated into English<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>.’ This was written
within a hundred years of Alfred’s death. For many books
of which the authorship has never been doubted we cannot
produce evidence anything like as early. I may note in
passing that in speaking of the translation of Gregory’s
Dialogues Ælfric makes no assertion as to the Alfredian
authorship, merely saying ‘the book has been translated
into English, and in it any one who will read it may learn
profitably of these matters<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>.’ In another place he gives
interesting evidence that, till he himself took pen in hand,
Alfred’s translations were the only books accessible to those
who did not know Latin<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of MSS.</div>

<p>Moreover the Cambridge University MS. of the Anglo-Saxon
Bede, which is said to be of the middle of the
eleventh century, has at the beginning and end the following
distich:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Historicus quondam fecit me Beda Latinum,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Alfred, rex Saxo, transtulit ille pius.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same MS. contains, between Bede’s Preface and the
History proper, a copy of the West Saxon genealogy in
the exact form in which it appears in MS. <img class="inline" src="images/a.jpg" width="20" height="20" alt="A" /> of the Saxon
Chronicle; i.e. it comes down to the accession of Alfred,
and no further. This again connects the work with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Alfred. The Cambridge MS. is, as far as we can test it,
an undoubted copy of one which exists in the library of
my own college. This is unfortunately imperfect, both at
the beginning and the end. But if, as is likely, it also
contained originally the distich and the pedigree, the
evidence is thrown yet further back<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>.</p>

<p>Curiously enough both Laȝamon<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> and Rudborne<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> speak
of the Saxon version as if it were Bede’s own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The negative
arguments
inconclusive. The argument
from
dialect.</div>

<p>§ 105. The question of its authorship must not be
regarded as outside the pale of discussion. Only I do not
think that the arguments hitherto advanced are sufficient
to establish a negative conclusion. As to Dr. Miller’s
Mercian theory, I may say at once that I have no pretensions
to pose as an expert in early English dialects.
I can get up no enthusiasm for the minute distinctions of
form and spelling which form their criteria. They have
for me only the practical and unpleasant interest that they
oblige me often to look up a word in three or four different
places in the dictionary before finding it. I may however
mention that Professor Schipper, the latest editor of the
Anglo-Saxon Bede<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>, does not regard the Mercian theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as established<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>. But even if it were established, it does
not seem to me incompatible with Alfred’s authorship. It
is agreed that all our existing MSS. go back to a single
archetype, though they branch off into two groups which
form to some extent a twofold recension<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>. The scribe
of that archetypal MS. may have been a Mercian, and
there may have been other MSS. in which these Mercian
peculiarities were wanting. Even if it be assumed (for it
certainly could not be proved), that this Mercian archetype
was the original MS. of all, it is equally open to us to
suppose that the scribe to whom Alfred dictated his translation
in the first instance may have been a Mercian. Or
again it is quite possible that the Mercian characteristics,
if they exist, may be due to the influence of the Mercian
scholars who assisted Alfred in his work—Plegmund,
Werferth, and the two Mercian chaplains mentioned by
Asser<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>. And it is some confirmation of this that there
is a certain affinity noticeable between the diction and
style of the Bede translation and that of the earlier or
unrevised version of the Dialogues, which, as we have
seen, there is good reason to attribute to Werferth<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Argument
from style. Influence
of Latin
on early
prose. The Bede
may never
have been
finally
revised.</div>

<p>§ 106. As to the over-literalness of the translation in
places, the fact must be admitted, though the extent of it
has been, I think, somewhat exaggerated. The cases fall
under three heads: (1) where a Latin construction is unidiomatically
imitated in the Saxon<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>; this applies especially
to constructions with the ablative absolute<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>, the accusative
and infinitive<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>, and the use of the passive voice<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>, the range
of which is much more restricted in Saxon than in Latin<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>;
(2) where a Latin word is translated by a Saxon one which
may correspond fairly well with the general meaning of
the Latin word, but does not give its sense in the particular
passage<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>; (3) where a phrase or sentence is translated, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
use Alfred’s own expression, ‘word by word,’ instead of
‘sense by sense<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>.’ To all these classes the explanation
suggested by Professor Schipper would often apply, viz.
that the translator may have embodied in his work interlinear
glosses which had been made to assist him; and he
cites in illustration the difference between the West Saxon
and Northumbrian versions of the Gospels, the former of
which is a genuine translation, while the latter is an interlinear
gloss made word for word<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>. Some however of the
cases where Latin constructions are reproduced, and also
one or two of the second class, give me the impression,
not that the translator could not have translated more
idiomatically if he had pleased, but rather that he was
trying experiments with the language. The development
of early prose in almost all European languages has been
largely influenced by Latin models, and it was only experience
which could show how far the process of assimilation
might be carried. Similarly for some two centuries after
the Renaissance English prose literature is full of experimentally
transplanted Latinisms, of which a large proportion
failed to make good their footing in the language.
Another possibility must also be borne in mind; that the
Bede may never have received Alfred’s final revision. We
have seen that in the case of the Dialogues an extensive
revision was found desirable at a later time, and we seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
have traces of a partial revision of the Bede in the younger
group of MSS. mentioned above, in which not only does
the translation vary, at times very considerably<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>, but a
passage is inserted which the earlier recension omits<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>, and
conversely<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>. When this partial revision was made I cannot
say, but probably not by Alfred himself. On the whole,
then, I do not regard Mr. Sweet’s or Dr. Miller’s argument
as conclusive, either against Alfred’s authorship of the Bede
translation, or against the priority of the Orosius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Omissions
made by
Alfred in
the Bede. The Easter
Controversy.</div>

<p>§ 107. I have already said<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> that the principal changes
made by Alfred in the Bede are in the way of omission,
the additions being comparatively slight. It is worth
while to see what considerations guided him in this. First
of all he omits almost all documents<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>, in two instances he
just gives a brief summary of a letter in oratio obliqua<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>.
He seems at first to have intended to omit the interrogations
and responses of Augustine and Gregory, but afterwards
to have changed his mind, as in all the MSS. they
occur after the third book instead of in their proper place
near the end of the first<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>. He also omits all the metrical
compositions, epitaphs, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>, which occur in the course of
the work. Then, too, he omits almost everything bearing
on the Easter Controversy<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>; partly no doubt because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
felt, as modern readers feel, the intolerable tediousness of
the whole thing; but partly also, we may well believe,
because he disliked the bitterness which even the gentle
Bede shows on this question<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>, for there are little touches
which seem to prove that the piety and self-devotion of
the Celtic missionaries had made a deep impression on his
heart<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>. The early history prior to the conversion of the
Saxons is also a good deal abbreviated<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>, no doubt as having
less direct interest for his readers. So the description of
the sacred places which Bede largely borrowed from
Arculfus is omitted, probably for similar reasons<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The additions
unimportant.</div>

<p>§ 108. It has often formed a subject both of wonder
and regret that Alfred should not have enriched the Bede
with additions drawn from his own knowledge of the
traditions of his people, as he might so easily have done.
Reverence for his original may have had something to do
with this; but I agree with Professor Wülker<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> that the
main reason probably was, because all that Alfred desired
in this line had already been done in the compilation of
the Saxon Chronicle. It is confirmatory of this that the
chronological summary appended to his history by Bede,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
which had, as I have elsewhere shown<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>, such an important
influence on the development of annalistic writing
in general, and of the Saxon Chronicle in particular, is
omitted in the Bede translation.</p>

<p>Smaller additions and expansions there are, but they
seldom really add anything to the narrative. They are
as a rule merely inserted to make it a little more clear<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>,
or a little more vivid, or a little more in accordance with
the translator’s ideas<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>. Occasionally, though rarely, they
show a touch of personal feeling; as where Diocletian is
characterised as the bad emperor<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>, Constantine as the
good emperor<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>, and Aidan as the good bishop<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>. Sometimes,
as in the other works, they are brief explanations
of things which the readers might not know<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>. Occasionally
statements of Bede’s are altered<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>, or omitted<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>, because
they were no longer applicable, or they are marked
distinctly as being Bede’s and not Alfred’s<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>. But in
other cases similar statements are retained, though it
would not be safe to argue from this that the state of
things indicated still subsisted in Alfred’s day<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mistakes.</div>

<p>Here too there are mistakes<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>, though fewer and less
serious than in the Orosius. In some cases they may be
due to erroneous readings in the MS. which Alfred used<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>.
In one or two instances Alfred’s version shows a remarkable
divergence of historical fact, which can hardly arise wholly
from misunderstanding<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merits of
the translation.</div>

<p>But on the whole the translation is a worthy one,
preserving, and in one or two instances enhancing<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>, the
beauty of the original, the most beautiful historical work
which the Church had produced since Luke and John wrote
their Gospels.</p>

<p>One incidental merit of the translation, as Stubbs has
remarked<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>, is that it enables us to equate the Saxon
technical terms of officers and institutions with the corresponding
Latin ones<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The translation of
Boethius. Fame
of the
original in
the Middle
Ages. Causes of this popularity;
its form. Sympathy
with the
author.</div>

<p>§ 109. We come now to what is in many respects the
most interesting and important of all Alfred’s literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
works, viz. the translation of Boethius on the Consolation
of Philosophy. It is here that the additions made by
Alfred to his original give us the clearest insight into his
own character and modes of thought. And the original is
in itself one of the most noteworthy books of the Middle
Ages. Just as Orosius was to those ages the accepted
manual of universal history<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>, and the Cura Pastoralis their
accepted manual of Spiritual Counsel, so the Consolatio
of Boethius was their accepted manual of practical and
speculative philosophy; the one channel through which
some tincture of ancient speculation passed into the popular
thought of the early Middle Ages. Perhaps no book
except the Bible and the Imitatio has been translated into
so many languages; and in more than one European
country the early translations of the Consolatio have had
an important influence on the development of a vernacular
literature<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>. For this popularity several reasons may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
given. Something was probably due to the form of the
work, which is written in that mixture of verse and prose
known as the Satura Menippaea<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>. The lyrics of the
Consolatio won the enthusiastic admiration of the great
Renaissance scholar, F. C. Scaliger<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>, and I must confess
that to me they seem extremely beautiful, though their
beauty is of a somewhat frosty order. But if they have
something of the hardness and coldness of marble, they
have also its purity and high polish<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>. But the chief
reason was, no doubt, sympathy with the author’s misfortunes,
whose sudden fall, from being the favourite and
chief minister of Theodoric, to prison and to death, made
him one of the most signal examples in that ever-lengthening
treatise De casibus illustrium uirorum, on which the Middle
Ages pondered with intense and morbid interest, feeding
that contempt for the world<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> and all things human,
which finds such passionate expression in many mediaeval
writings:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was

<p>To this power of the work as a record of human suffering
pathetic testimony is borne by the title of an anonymous
French translation of the fifteenth century, which announces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
itself as the work of ’un pauvre clerc désolé, quérant sa
consolation par la traduction de cestui livre<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>’; it is the
book to which Dante resorted for comfort after the death
of Beatrice<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>; and our own Sir Thomas More while in
prison wrote an imitation of Boethius, which he calls
‘Three Books of Comfort in Tribulation<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>.’ ‘Dost thou
think,’ asks Philosophy of Boethius in Alfred’s translation,
‘that to thee alone such change of state and sorrow have
come<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>?’ And, in spite of Tennyson, the fact ‘that loss
is common’ does ‘make Our own less bitter<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>’; and the
‘sense of tears in mortal things<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>’ knits mankind together
in bonds of sympathy which do make the common burden
lighter. And in the case of Boethius this natural feeling
was heightened by the erroneous impression, which prevailed
in the Middle Ages, that the sufferings of Boethius
were due to the rage of an Arian ruler against his Catholic
servant<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>. A superficial inspection of dates is sufficient to
dispel this illusion<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>; and how little support it derives from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the work itself is shown by the fact, that few questions in
literary history have been more keenly debated than the
question, whether the author was a Christian at all<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>. The
question turns largely on the authenticity of certain theological
tracts which bear the name of Boethius, and do
not concern us here<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>. On the whole it is probable that
Boethius was by profession a Christian, though it would
seem that his Christianity did not go very deep. Certainly
in the hour of trouble, which generally shows the real basis
of a man’s thought and character, he turns for consolation,
not to the doctrines of Christianity, but to the teachings
of Neo-platonic philosophy; and I unhesitatingly affirm
that there is far more of the spirit of Christianity in the
writings of acknowledged pagans like Seneca and Marcus
Aurelius, than in this work of a nominal Christian, who
enforces the duty of prayer, not by the authority of Christ
and His Apostles, but by that of Plato in the Timaeus<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This non-Christian
character
concealed
by glosses
and commentaries,
from
which many of
Alfred’s
additions
are
derived.</div>

<p>§ 110. It might have been thought that this absence of
any distinctively Christian character would have militated
against the popularity of the Consolatio in the Middle
Ages. That it did not do so was due partly to causes
already enumerated, partly to the fact that the non-Christian
character of the work was to some extent concealed
by the Christian interpretation given to various
passages in the commentaries and glosses on Boethius;
which interpretations were in turn embodied in the different
translations of the Consolatio, at the head of which stands
Alfred’s version.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yet the
additions
illustrate
Alfred’s
thought.</div>

<p>This interesting fact, that many of the additions in
Alfred’s Boethius, especially those of a distinctly Christian
character, are not really due to Alfred himself but to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
glosses and commentaries which were used by him or his
learned assistants, was first pointed out by Dr. Schepss in
a very suggestive article in the Archiv für’s Studium der
neueren Sprachen<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>. It is much to be regretted that
Dr. Schepss’ death prevented him from pursuing this line
of investigation further. Till this field has been fully
explored, we incur the danger of citing as specially
characteristic of Alfred something which he only borrowed
from others. In some instances I have noticed that the
additions made by Alfred are really taken from, or at least
suggested by other passages in the text of Boethius<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>.
But, when all deductions have been made, there remains
enough that we may safely take as evidence of Alfred’s
thought and feeling. I have already cited the passage
bearing on the needs and instruments of a king<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>. This
was to some extent suggested by a commentary, but it is
instinct with the mind of Alfred, as is the oft-quoted
sentence with which the chapter closes: ‘My will was
to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to
leave to them that should come after my memory in good
works<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>.’ Very Alfredian too are the thoughts that reward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
should not be looked for in this world<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>, but should be
sought from God alone<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>; that a good name is better than
any wealth<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>; that true nobility is of the mind, not of the
body<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>; that an honest purpose is accepted, even though
its accomplishment be frustrated<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>; that a king without
free subjects is nothing worth<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>; that no one should be
idle<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>, or wish to live a soft life<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>. But perhaps the noblest
passage is that in which by a splendid metaphor Philosophy
is made to say: ‘When I with my servants mount aloft,
then do we look down upon the stormy world, even as the
eagle when he soars above the clouds in stormy weather, so
that the storms cannot hurt him<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>’;—a metaphor which
so strikingly expresses Alfred’s own soaring superiority
to what he elsewhere calls ‘the wind of stern labours, and
the rain of excessive anxiety<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wealth of
similes in
the translation.</div>

<p>And this brings me to another point. If any one will
look through the additions made by Alfred to the text of
Boethius, which are very conveniently distinguished by
italic type in Mr. Sedgefield’s handy rendering of Alfred’s
version into modern English<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>, he can hardly fail to notice
how many of them consist in metaphors and similes; none
perhaps so fine as that just quoted, but often of great
interest and beauty<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>. Even where the simile was suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
by something in the text or commentary which
Alfred had before him, it is often developed at much
greater length. This is a point of some interest, because
it shows that Alfred’s mind was of the class which delights
in parable and figure, and makes it not unreasonable to
look for deeper meanings in what he wrote and wrought<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discussion
on Fate
and Freewill.</div>

<p>§ 111. I have said that the subject of fate occupies
a prominent place in the Consolatio and in Alfred’s translation
of it<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>. The relation of fate to providence, of divine
foreknowledge to human freedom, the nature of evil, the
existence of chance, these are the high themes round which
much of the latter part of the argument circles. They are
the themes which occupied the more intellectual spirits
among Milton’s fallen angels:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Others apart sat on a hill retired</div>
<div class="verse">In thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high</div>
<div class="verse">Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,</div>
<div class="verse">Fix’d fate, freewill, foreknowledge absolute,</div>
<div class="verse">And found no end, in wand’ring mazes lost<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And fallen man has succeeded as little as fallen angel in
solving these high doubts. Alfred realises, as indeed does
Boethius, the arduous nature of the inquiry; and his conclusion
is, as we should expect, much more than is the
case with Boethius, the conclusion of Christian faith and
practical Christian piety: ‘I say, as do all Christian men,
that it is the divine purpose that rules, and not Fate<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>.’
He sees, as all moralists have seen, that morality is only
possible on a basis of freedom, that fatalism reduces vice
and virtue, punishment and reward to unmeaning terms<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
‘To men and to angels God gave the gift of freedom that
they might do good or evil, whichever they pleased<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>.…
But if it be true that the good and the wicked are so made
as to be unable to act otherwise than they do, then vain is
our labour when we pray, and fast, or give alms, if we
have no more thank therefor than those who in all things
… run after their fleshly lusts<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>; … and vain too is the
commandment which God gave to man that he should
eschew evil and do good<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>.’ God knows all our works,
before we even conceive them in our thought; but this
knowledge is not a cause compelling us so to act, any
more than the knowledge of the steersman that a storm
is coming, is the cause of the storm<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
points
characteristic
of
Alfred.</div>

<p>There are other points which illustrate Alfred’s studies,
tastes, and circumstances; the saying that in the golden
age no one had heard of a pirate host<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>; the allusion to
the wise goldsmith, Weland<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>; the explanations about
India and Thule<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>.</p>

<p>And there are things in the text itself which evidently
come home to Alfred; the beauty of gems<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>, the fairness
of the country-side—the fairest of all God’s creations<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>,
the song of the birds in the woods<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>, the worth of

<div class="sidenote">Omissions.</div>

<p>Here too, as in the case of the Orosius, Alfred has
modified his original by omissions as well as additions;
but it is unnecessary to go minutely into this point, as
Mr. Sedgefield has prefixed to his edition of Alfred’s
version an elaborate table showing the relation of that
version to the original<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>.</p>

<p>§ 112. In regard to the translation as a whole no doubt
has ever been expressed as to the authorship of Alfred<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>;
and it is the only one of Alfred’s works which is mentioned
by name by Ethelwerd, who wrote towards the end
of the tenth century<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>. There is, however, an interesting
literary question connected with it, which is this. The
translation exists in only two MSS., one in the Cottonian
Collection<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>, the other in the Bodleian<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>. In the older or

in the later or Bodleian MS. they are rendered into prose.
It is as to Alfred’s authorship of the alliterative poems
that the controversy has raged; and those who deny their
authenticity are compelled to deny also the authenticity of
the two proems in prose and verse<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>, in both of which the
poems are distinctly ascribed to Alfred. The question,
though interesting as a literary problem, is not intrinsically
of great importance. The poems are not of the highest
order, though they have been, I think, unduly depreciated.
Alfred’s fame will not be much exalted if he wrote them,
or much depressed if they should be adjudged to another.
I must confess, however, that a great deal of the argument
on the negative side seems to me to be of that purely
arbitrary and subjective kind which in its ultimate analysis
amounts to this: ‘it can’t have been so, because I don’t
think that it was<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Logical
result of
this style
of criticism.</div>

<p>§ 113. One thing is agreed on all sides; the verse translation
is made from the prose translation, and is not an
independent rendering made direct from the Latin; and
the main argument of the negative critics is that it is
impossible to suppose that a man like Alfred can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
occupied himself in turning his own vigorous prose into
indifferent verse. On this I would remark: first, does it
follow, because Alfred was a great man and a great prose-writer,
that he was also necessarily a considerable poet<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>?
Secondly, if Alfred wrote the verses, does it necessarily
follow that <i>he</i> thought them poor and unworthy of the
trouble of making? Great writers are not always gifted
with the faculty of self-criticism; otherwise we should not
have Wordsworth taking apparently equal pleasure in the
composition of Betty Foy and of Laodamia. Indeed, on
my conscience, I believe that he liked Betty Foy the better
of the two<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>. Thirdly, even if Alfred were conscious of
his limitations as a poet, is it not possible that his conscientious
spirit may have felt bound to give as true a
representation of the original as possible, by reproducing
one of its most salient features, the alternation of verse
and prose? In truth this style of criticism, if logically
carried out, would lead us very far. It would prove, for
instance, that at least two hands were concerned in the
composition of the third book of Wordsworth’s Prelude.
That book contains the glorious and well-known lines:—</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But it also contains the no less well-known, but most

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It would also prove (to take a closer parallel) that the late
Professor Conington never wrote a verse translation of the
Aeneid. Unlike Alfred, Mr. Conington was, as we all
know, a very considerable Latin scholar; but I must be
pardoned for saying that, like Alfred, he was not a very
considerable poet. He wrote a prose translation of the
Aeneid, of which he thought so little that it was not
published till after his death; he wrote a verse translation
of the same poem, of which he evidently thought a good
deal. Yet can we not imagine a German critic a thousand
years hence arguing that the author of the prose translation
could never have penned a couplet like the following?—</p>

<p>§ 114. For my own part, so far from regarding the
existence of the prose translation of Boethius’ Metra as
inconsistent with Alfred’s authorship of the alliterative
version, I am inclined to regard the former as intended
from the first to serve as the basis of the latter. I would
bring into connexion with this the interesting statement
of William of Malmesbury, that Asser, for Alfred’s benefit,
unravelled the meaning of the De Consolatione in plainer
words; ‘a labour,’ says Malmesbury, with the sniff of the
superior person, ‘in those days necessary, in ours ridiculous<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>.’
Zimmermann understood this as meaning a preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
translation made by Asser. ‘Entschieden falsch,’
cries Professor Wülker<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>, with the usual brusqueness of
a German critic. But the criticism may be retorted on
his own explanation that Asser glossed a manuscript for
the king’s use. The passage clearly refers to a paraphrase
of the original in simpler language, and more natural
order, like that which occupies the margin of some of the
Delphin Classics, an illustration which had occurred to
myself before I knew that Dr. Schepss had also made use
of it in his admirable essay referred to above<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>. It is an
interesting fact that in the case of early High German
we possess just such a paraphrase of this very work.
This is how Mr. Stewart, in his excellent monograph on
Boethius, describes the translation of the Consolatio made
by Notker III of St. Gallen, about a century after Alfred’s
time: ‘His method of translation is to give a sentence or
group of words of the original, which he arranges for the
sake of his pupils in as simple and straightforward a form
as possible, followed by the German equivalent. This last
is expanded, as the occasion seems to require, by passages
of explanation and paraphrase of varying length<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>.’ Except
as to the ‘German equivalent,’ this illustrates very aptly
what I conceive to have been Asser’s procedure. It also
illustrates the way in which many of Alfred’s additions
may have found their way into his translation. And it
would be especially in the poetical portions of the work
that such a paraphrase, giving the words of the original
in a less intricate order, would be required. So that while
Asser paraphrased Boethius’ poetry in prose, Alfred, by
a reverse process, first translated Asser’s prose into prose,
and then at a later time paraphrased his own prose version
in verse. That, in the interval which elapsed between the
two versions, the earlier edition should have been copied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and circulated, that at a later time scribes should have
prefixed to copies of the first edition the prose proem which
in strictness is only applicable to the second, is easily
intelligible<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>; and it is curious that to this also an almost
exact parallel can be produced from the fortunes of the
Consolatio in another European country. There exist in
French two thirteenth-century translations of the Consolatio.
To quote Mr. Stewart once more: ‘The one is in
prose, a word-for-word rendering; … the other, a more
scholarly performance, follows the scheme of the Latin
original’; i.e. in the alternation of verse and prose. Yet
to both versions the same prologue is prefixed, in which
the translation which follows is in each case attributed to
Jehan de Meun<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>. That Alfred intended from the first
to give a verse rendering of the Metra, and that he did
not see his way at once to carry out his intention, seems
to me to be hinted at in a passage near the end of the
book, which has very little corresponding to it in the
original: ‘It is nigh unto the time when I had purposed
to take other work in hand, and I have not yet done with
this; … I cannot now so soon sing it, nor have I leisure
therefor<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>.’</p>

<p>Another point which, as Hartmann showed<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>, tells in
favour of Alfred’s authorship is the way in which in the
poems references are made to the prose portions of the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The attack
has broken
down.</div>

<p>On the whole I regard the attack on Alfred’s authorship
of the Metra as having decidedly broken down<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>; and in
this opinion I am glad to have the concurrence of a very
competent critic in the Times of August 20, 1901. I am
breaking no confidence in identifying that critic with my
friend and teacher Professor Earle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
last work,
the Soliloquies, or
‘Blooms.’</div>

<p>§ 115. The last undoubted work of Alfred’s that has
come down to us is one which bears the title ‘Blooms,’ or,
as we might say, ‘Anthology<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>.’ The first two books are
derived mainly from St. Augustine’s two books of Soliloquies.
The first book and part of the second follow the
original fairly closely, but the remainder of the second
book is very free, and is mainly Alfred’s own. The third
book is based to some extent on St. Augustine’s Epistle to
Paulina on the Vision of God, with additions from the De
Ciuitate Dei, St. Gregory’s Dialogues, the Moralia, together
with reflexions of Alfred’s own<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>. The use of the De Ciuitate
Dei is especially interesting, as it was the favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
book of Charles the Great<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>. It is a noteworthy proof of
Alfred’s advance in literary art, that whereas in this third
book his materials were not originally in dialogue form, he
has very skilfully thrown them into that form in order to
make them harmonise with the first two books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad state
of the text.</div>

<p>The work has come down to us in a pitiable condition,
in a single late and corrupt manuscript, mutilated both at
the beginning and end, and with evident lacunae in other
places. At the beginning part of the preface is gone; at
the end I do not myself think that more is lost than part
of the final colophon; the concluding words of the actual
text seem to me to mark undoubtedly the close of the
work. Professor Wülker indeed thought otherwise; but
he was led to his conclusion partly by the wish to give
greater probability to his theory which would identify this
work with Alfred’s Encheiridion or Commonplace Book;
a theory from which, as already stated<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>, I strongly dissent,
and which Wülker himself has since withdrawn<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>. Still
even in its ruin the work reflects clearly the features of its
author. The Preface in particular is so characteristic that,
as it is comparatively little known, I give it here:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Preface.</div>

<p>‘I gathered me then staves, and props, and bars, and
helves for each of my tools, and boughs; and for each of
the works that I could work, I took the fairest trees, so far
as I might carry them away. Nor did I ever bring any
burden home without longing to bring home the whole
wood, if that might be; for in every tree I saw something
of which I had need at home. Wherefore I exhort every
one who is strong and has many wains, that he direct his
steps to the same wood where I cut the props. Let him
there get him others, and load his wains with fair twigs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that he may weave thereof many a goodly wain, and set up
many a noble house, and build many a pleasant town, and
dwell therein in mirth, and ease, both winter and summer,
as I could never do hitherto. But He who taught me to
love that wood, He may cause me to dwell more easily,
both in this transitory dwelling … while I am in the
world, and also in the eternal home which He has promised
us through … the holy fathers. And so I believe He
will do for their merits, both make this [earthly] way
better than it was ere this, or at least enlighten the eyes
of my mind, that I may find the right way to the eternal
home, and to the eternal country, and to the eternal rest,
which is promised to us through the holy fathers. So
be it.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Significance
of
this
Preface. It is the
Epilogue
to Alfred’s
literary
works.</div>

<p>§ 116. It is Alfred looking back over the whole of his
storm-tossed life, and realising that the calm haven is close
at hand<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>, and that he must leave it to others to carry on
the work which he had begun. Professor Wülker, in the
interest of the theory alluded to above, says that this
preface refers to a larger collection than any to be found
in these three books of ‘Blooms<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a>.’ True; most true. But
the larger collection to which it refers is not this, or any
other single work of his, however hypothetically enlarged;
but the whole of his literary works. And just as the
Preface to the Pastoral Care is in some sense a Prologue to
the whole collection, so this is, in a very real sense, the
Epilogue. We may not, here in Oxford, claim Alfred as
our founder; but surely our hearts may be uplifted at the
thought, that in all that we do here in the cause of true
learning and of genuine education, we are carrying on the
work which Alfred left us to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The most
mature of Alfred’s
works.</div>

<p>The book is in other ways also the most mature of
Alfred’s works. It is very closely related to the Boethius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
both in thought and diction<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>. And just as in the Orosius
we had a foretaste of the discussion on fate which holds
so prominent a place in the Boethius<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>, so the subject of
the immortality of the soul, which is only just touched on
in the Boethius<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>, is here developed at length<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>. And here,
as in the Boethius, Alfred’s conclusion is much more distinctly
Christian than that of his original. The Soliloquies
is one of Augustine’s earliest works, written at a time when
a good deal of the gentile rhetorician still hung about him<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>.
It must be confessed that his philosophical arguments on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
this subject are not very convincing, but in Alfred they
are strongly reinforced by the authority of Scripture and
of the fathers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wealth of
similes.</div>

<p>Here, too, many of the additions which Alfred makes to
his original consist of those similes and parables<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> which
he loved so well; the most beautiful perhaps being one in
which the soul made fast to God is compared to a ship
riding securely on her anchor<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion
of author
and translator.</div>

<p>§ 117. I have said that in the third book Alfred casts
into a dialogue form materials which have not that shape
in the original. The interlocutors still remain as before,
Augustine and Reason. It is a quaint proof of the
completeness with which Alfred lost the sense of translation
in the consciousness of authorship, that in a passage
where the De uidendo Deo is spoken of, the Augustine of
the dialogue is made to say: ‘I have not now leisure to go
through all that book<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>,’ although the historical Augustine
was the actual author of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Characteristic
thoughts.</div>

<p>Of thoughts characteristic of Alfred I will quote but
two. The first is this: ‘No man may do aught of good
unless God work with him. And yet no one should be
idle and not attempt something in proportion to the powers
which God gives him<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>.’ The other is contained in the last
sentence of the book<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>. And I think you will feel with me
that we have here ‘the conclusion of the whole matter’;
that anything added to this would be of the nature of an
anticlimax: ‘Therefore he seems to me a very foolish man,
and very wretched, who will not increase his understanding
while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach
that endless life where all shall be made clear.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred’s
last words.</div>

<p>They are the last words not merely of this book; they
are the last words of Alfred to us all across the chasm of
a thousand years. We have seen some reason for thinking
that the earliest of Alfred’s own works, the Pastoral Care,
cannot be earlier than 894<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>; and as the years 894-6 were
largely occupied with warfare<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>, it is probable that Alfred’s
literary activity falls mainly into the last four years of his
reign, those four silent years for which our authorities fail
us almost wholly, but in which Alfred had something of
that ‘stillness’ for which he wishes in the Preface to the
Pastoral Care.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alfred
and his
grandson
Athelstan.</div>

<p>One little glimpse we do get of him during his later
years. William of Malmesbury, who had special materials
for the life of Athelstan<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>, tells us how he, a child, like
Alfred himself, of singular beauty and attractiveness, was
invested by his famous grandsire, who discerned his early
promise, with a scarlet cloak, a jewelled belt, and a Saxon
sword with golden scabbard<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>. And thus Alfred inherited
the twofold blessing of the Psalmist: ‘Thou shalt see thy
children’s children, and peace upon Israel.’ Nor was it
least among Alfred’s blessings that he left a son like
Edward, and a grandson like Athelstan, to carry on his
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death and
character
of Alfred.</div>

<p>§ 118. It was while he was occupied with these high
thoughts of Providence and immortality, that he passed
away. How the call came to him to quit these shadows
for the ‘life where all things are made clear’ we do not
know. We only know that it came on October 26, and
probably in the year 900<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>. He was only fifty-two. But
even if the tradition of his constant illness be rejected,
he had been through what might well have worn out even
a strong man in a shorter time. Those who witnessed the
extinction of so great a light might have exclaimed with
Shakespeare’s tawny queen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘And there is nothing left remarkable</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath the visiting moon<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Florence’s noble panegyric on Alfred is well known, where
he tells how there passed away ‘Alfred the king of the
Anglo-Saxons, the son of the most pious king Æthelwulf,
the famous, the warlike, the victorious, the careful provider
for the widow, the helpless<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>, the orphan and the poor; the
most skilled of Saxon poets, most dear to his own nation,
courteous to all, most liberal; endowed with prudence,
fortitude, justice and temperance; most patient in the
infirmity from which he continually suffered; the most
discerning investigator in executing justice, most watchful
and devout in the service of God<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>.’ Even the turgid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
tasteless Ethelwerd becomes simple and dignified in the
face of this great event. ‘There passed from the world,’
he says, ‘the high-souled Alfred, the immovable pillar of
the West Saxons; a man full of justice, learned in discourse,
imbued especially with the sacred Scriptures, … whose
body rests at Winchester in peace. O reader, breathe the
prayer “Christ, the Redeemer, save his soul<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>.”’ He must
be a stern Protestant who would refuse to obey Ethelwerd’s
behest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lessons of
Alfred’s
life.</div>

<p>§ 119. Some of us probably know the story of the little
boy who, when asked in an examination paper a foolish
question as to what Alfred, if he were alive now, would
think of certain present-day problems, made the sage reply:
‘If King Alfred were alive now, he would be much too
old to take any interest in politics.’ It was an instance,
sublime, though unconscious, of answering a fool according
to his folly. And yet we should surely be wrong if we
thought that, because Alfred died a thousand years ago, his
life and work have therefore no lessons for ourselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Army. Navy. Learning. Education.</div>

<p>The question may not be of dividing the national militia
into two parts, one to be at home and one out; but the
problem still confronts us how to provide an army which
shall both defend our shores at home, and also be adequate
to the needs of the empire abroad. The question may not
be whether our ships shall be built on Frisian or on Danish
lines; but there are problems of naval construction on the
right solution of which the safety of England may very
largely depend. The knowledge of Latin is happily not
extinct among us now, as it practically was in Alfred’s
day; but the necessity still exists, which he felt so strongly,
to mediate between the best thoughts of the past and the
needs and aspirations of the present; while in education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
we have hardly perhaps fully realised even Alfred’s modest
wish that ‘all the youth of England of free men … be set
to learn … until that they are well able to read English
writing<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>.’</p>

<p>Again, few things are more striking in Alfred, than the
way in which he keeps an equal hand on all branches of
the national life, army, navy, church, justice, finance,
education, learning. It is no doubt a harder task to
co-ordinate the administration of an empire with world-wide
possessions and world-wide responsibilities, than of
a little state like Wessex. But we need something of this
unifying guidance from above, if our government is not to
fall apart into a chaos of independent, and possibly jealous
and hostile departments. But above all we need Alfred’s
high faith; a faith first of all, unswerving, unfaltering,
in an over-ruling Providence, the guidance of a Higher
Hand; but faith also in the destiny of his country and
his people. Had he, like Burgred of Mercia, given up
the struggle in despair, and gone as a pilgrim to Rome,
no one in his own day would have thought the worse of
him; and he might have won that pale halo of mediaeval
saintship, which, as it was, he did not gain<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>. But England
would have been lost to Christianity<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>; and Alfred had
faith that it was not in the purposes of God so far to roll
back the tide of progress, as to let England become once
more a heathen land. Surely Alfred stands high in the
muster roll of those ‘Who through faith subdued kingdoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
wrought righteousness, … turned to flight the armies of
the aliens<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal
character.</div>

<p>And we need scarcely less that force of individual
character which was the secret, as we have seen, of so
much of Alfred’s power. To realise this, we have only
to compare him for instance with Henry II, a man who
in mere intellectual capacity was possibly his superior, and
whose reign conferred incalculable benefits upon England.
But his aims were merely selfish, and his life impure; and
so the greatness of his achievement is known to few beyond
professed students of history<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>.</p>

to us are Marcus Aurelius, the imperial saint of paganism,
Louis IX, the royal saint of mediaevalism, Charles the
Great, and our own Edward I. But the sad self-suppression
of Marcus Aurelius, the melancholy refrain which
seems to sigh through the golden book of his thoughts,</p>

can be.</p>

<p>Charles the Great is of course one of the most towering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
figures in the whole of history. Alike in physical and
intellectual strength he is head and shoulders above all
his predecessors and successors. We have noticed several
points of taste and character in which Alfred resembled
him<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>, and they were alike too in the large and generous
activities of their many-sided natures. Charles worked no
doubt on a gigantic scale, to which Alfred can make no
pretence. But this very fact has given to Alfred’s work
a permanence which is wanting to that of Charles. Every
succeeding century has but verified more and more Alfred’s
vision of a united England, and has led her on gradually
to an empire of which neither Charles nor Alfred could
have dreamed<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>. Every succeeding century has given the
lie to Charles’s system of a united Germany and France:</p>

<p class="noindent">But, apart from this, there are stains on Charles’s character,

Walafrid Strabo in a curious passage places him in
purgatory<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>, the occasional outbursts of cruelty which on

<div class="sidenote">Edward I.</div>

<p>Edward I is one of the noblest monarchs who ever sat
upon an earthly throne; brave, and dutiful, and true.
But we have only to think of his lawyerlike, almost tradesmanlike,
way of suing for his pound of flesh on the letter
of his bond, and then recall Alfred’s comment on the golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
rule: ‘by this one law every one may know how he ought
to judge another, he needs no other law book<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>,’ in order to
feel the difference between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Louis.</div>

<p>It is only when I think of St. Louis that my heart
becomes a little divided. St. Louis is, to my thinking,
one of the most beautiful characters in the whole of
history. His saintliness is no doubt of the mediaeval
type. But this is not surprising, seeing that he lived in
the thirteenth century, the central and culminating period
of the Middle Ages. Dante, and Joan of Arc, and Thomas
à Kempis are mediaeval too. And he went on Crusade,
when, according to every utilitarian standard, he would
have been better employed in governing his own kingdom.
Yet I, at least, cannot love him less, because as a ‘young
man’ he ‘saw visions,’ and went on the quest of the Holy
Grail. And he was fortunate in his biographer. What
would we not give to have, instead of Asser’s stilted and
confused Latin, a memoir of Alfred in our native tongue
which might rank with Joinville’s picture of his master?
And yet in some ways the very saintliness of Louis became
a curse to France; for it shed a consecration on an evil
despotism, which finally exploded in one of the most hideous
convulsions in history:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It seems a hard thing to say, but there is a very real connexion
between St. Louis and the French Revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No deductions

<p>Alfred on the other hand is one of the very few rulers
whose work in life, and whose memory after death have
been, as far as may be said of anything here below, an
unmixed blessing to their peoples. Alfred’s aspiration
has indeed been abundantly fulfilled: ‘My will was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to live worthily as long as I lived; and after my life to
leave to them that should come after my memory in good

to place so great a memory in a clearer light, and to
sweep away some of the false traditions by which it has
been obscured, I shall regard myself as having done a real,
if humble, service, not only to historical truth, but also to
the national life. We need to keep our historical memories
not only fresh but true. For, in the words of the great
historian, with the remembrance of whom I began these
lectures: ‘The healthy nation has a memory as well as
aspirations involved in the consciousness of its identity; it
has a past no less living than its future<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>.’</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.…
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due;
custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
honour.’—<span class="smcap">Rom.</span> xiii. 1, 7.</p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible, I think, to read the Epistles of the New
Testament with any degree of attention, and not to see how
anxious the writers are that the Christianity which they preach
should not be regarded as a revolutionary and explosive force,
upsetting and destroying existing institutions, social and
political; how concerned they are that their converts should
give no offence (beyond what was involved in the fact of their
religion) to the heathen neighbours among whom they lived;
that they should ‘Walk in wisdom toward them that are
without<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>,’ and have their ‘conversation honest among the
Gentiles<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>’; how careful they are to say no word which should
disturb the existing relations of slaves and masters, of wives
and husbands, of subjects and sovereigns; even though the
sovereign, the husband, the master might be heathen, and
the slave, the wife, the subject might be Christian. If there
must be a breach, let it come from the heathen member of
the bond. The rule for the Christian was: ‘let him not
depart<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>.’</p>

<p>And, in thus writing, the Apostles were but following out
the teaching and example of our Lord Himself. When He
compares the kingdom of Heaven to leaven<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>, He means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
I suppose, that the working of His doctrine was to be, as
a rule, gradual and assimilative, not sudden and explosive.</p>

<p>And He Himself always refused to assume the part of
a political agitator, or even of a social reformer, which His
followers sometimes wished to thrust upon Him. ‘He withdrew
Himself,’ when the multitudes threatened to ‘take Him
by force, to make Him a king<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>’; He would not be ‘a judge
or a divider’ in matters of inheritance<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>. All social and
political problems He left men to work out for themselves
with the powers which God has given them, under the
guidance and control of God’s ordinary providence; and to
apply for themselves to the solution of these problems the
principles of His teaching, under the ordinary operations of
the Holy Spirit. And this refusal to interfere with the normal
development of human society emphasises all the more, as has
been remarked<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>. His uncompromising vindication of the law
of marriage, as the one social institution the sanctity of which
is above all human laws: ‘God made them male and female<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>.’</p>

<p>He would not agitate against the tribute<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>; though the refusal
probably cost Him the popularity which had manifested itself
so noisily in the triumphal entry. And, in His trial before
Pilate, He distinctly recognised the Roman provincial government
of Judaea, heathen and foreign though it was, as being
divinely ordered: ‘Thou couldest have no power at all against
me, except it were given thee from above<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>.’</p>

<p>When the publicists of the middle ages, with Dante at their
head, laid stress on the birth and death of Christ under the
Roman Empire as giving a divine authority to that Empire,
and to the mediaeval Empire which claimed to be its successor<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
they were but carrying to somewhat fanciful extremes an argument
based upon undoubted facts.</p>

<p>And so St. Paul, in the passage which I have taken for my
text, claims no less than a divine sanction for the civil power:
‘The powers that be are ordained of God.… Render therefore
to all their dues.’ And the magnitude of the claim is enhanced,
if we remember that this was written, not under any of the
better Roman emperors; not under Trajan, whose virtues so
touched the heart of the Middle Ages, that they represented his
soul as transferred to Paradise through the intercession of
St. Gregory, the apostle of the English<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>; not under a philosophic
saint like Marcus Aurelius; but, probably, under the
vain and vicious Nero.</p>

<p>If then such was the claim on the duty of subjects then,
how much greater the claim on us, who, for more than sixty
years, have lived under one of the very best of Christian
sovereigns.</p>

<p>We can most of us remember the kind of thought and speech
which was prevalent not so many years ago. It was a common
impression then that the part to be played by the institution of
Royalty in the future history of the world was a very slight
one. The growth of popular power, the spread of education,
and other causes, would reduce it to be nothing more than the
veil, and a very transparent veil, of a Democracy.</p>

<p>The history of the last quarter of a century has signally
falsified this forecast; and the present state of Europe gives it
an emphatic contradiction. At the present moment the question
of war or peace, that is for thousands, if not millions, the
question of life or death, hangs upon the fiat of some four or
five men.</p>

<p>Nor is the view of the insignificance of Royalty borne out by
the history of England as a whole.</p>

<p>The story of English Royalty reaches back some fourteen
hundred years. In 519, according to the traditional account,
Certic and Cynric assumed the kingship of the West Saxons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and the reflexion of the compiler of the Saxon Chronicle,
writing probably under Alfred, that ‘the royal house of the
West Saxons has ruled ever since that day,’ has, with the
exception of the Norman period, remained almost literally
true down to the present time. For it was Wessex which
grew into England; and the first idea of union, loosely and
imperfectly realised under Egbert, was gradually wrought out
in many years of suffering. Alfred saved England from the
Danes, though at a tremendous sacrifice, and holds in real
history the place which romance assigns to Arthur; a Christian
king,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Scarce other than my own ideal knight,’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">who rolls back the tide of heathen conquest from his native
land. We call him, and we call him rightly, ‘Alfred the Great.’
But in days nearer his own he was known as ‘England’s
Darling.’ Will not the historian of the future see a certain
sad appropriateness in the fact that the Queen should have
died in the year which is to celebrate the millenary of the
death of this, the greatest of her ancestors, the one whom she
so much resembled in her unswerving loyalty to duty, her
constant labour for the good of her people, her unfaltering
allegiance to truth? ‘The most thoughtful provider for the
widow, the defenceless, the orphan, and the poor, … most
beloved by his people,’ says Florence of Alfred. Asser calls
him ‘Alfred the truth-teller’; and we all remember how the
great tribune of the people, as he was sometimes called,
declared that the Queen was the most truthful person he had
ever known.</p>

<p>So too after the fierce suffering of the Norman Conquest, it
was Henry II who knit the framework of the country together
by an administrative system, under the forms of which we, to
a large extent, still live; while Edward I, taking up the idea,
which Simon de Montfort seemed to have lighted upon almost
by accident, made popular representation the permanent basis
of our constitution, on the express ground that ‘what touches
all, should be approved by all.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more, in the religious crisis of the sixteenth century,
Henry VIII and Elizabeth, whatever their shortcomings, did
much to impress upon the English Church that sane and sober
character of a via media, which, in spite of extremists on either
side, it has kept ever since.</p>

<p>We do not, at this stage of our national history, expect
services quite of this kind from the Crown. And yet the
services which it has rendered during the late reign have
been simply immense. To take only two of the most obvious;
two, on which the late Mr. Bagehot was fond of dwelling:—(1)
It has been the symbol and sign of our unity, not only as
a nation, but as an empire. In every quarter of the globe,
millions upon millions of her subjects, who knew little or
nothing of the nature of Parliaments, of the theory of constitutional
government, of the responsibility of ministers, of the rise
and fall of parties, looked up to the Queen as the bond of union
between them, the mother and head of a vast family dispersed
throughout the whole world; and this feeling had been deepened
and strengthened to an extraordinary degree by the events of
the last fifteen months.</p>

<p>(2) And closely connected with this is the second point. The
experience of more than three-and-sixty years has taught us to
look up to the Crown as the head of our home and family life.
This has not always, indeed has not often been the case, in
English, or in any other history. The feeling in our own case
has owed something to the homely virtues of King George III,
but almost everything to the unfailing love and sympathy of
the Queen. In joy and sorrow, the humblest of her subjects
might feel that they had a share in her sympathy and care.
And this sympathy was not of that easy kind which stoops
from painless heights to look upon the woes of others, but had
been won through depths of suffering and sorrow; and the
comfort which she gave to others was, in the Apostle’s words,
‘the comfort wherewith’ she herself had been ‘comforted of
God<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it is these two elements which come out most
strongly in the universal grief called forth by the heavy
blow which has fallen upon us. We have lost our mother,
the head of our vast family; and we go forth, like orphans in
the night, to meet the unknown trials of a new century, without
the guidance of that wisely moderating hand, without the
sympathy of that feeling heart, to which we had learned to
turn with a habit which had become an instinct.</p>

<p>‘Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute
is due; … fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.’ May
we not add, what was hardly possible in the then circumstances
of the Roman world, ‘love to whom love’?</p>

<p>‘I exhort therefore,’ says the Apostle in another place, ‘that,
first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of
thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in
authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>.’ Surely we have need, at the present
time, to obey this exhortation. ‘Supplications, prayers, intercessions,’
shall we not offer these for our new ruler and all his
subjects? One of the earliest Christian prayers which has
come down to us is a prayer for rulers in the Epistle of
St. Clement of Rome<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>:—‘Do Thou, Lord, direct their counsel,
according to that which is good and well-pleasing in Thy
sight; that, administering in peace and gentleness, with godliness,
the power which Thou hast given them, they may obtain
Thy favour.’ Eighteen centuries have not made that prayer
obsolete, or unnecessary. If there is much that is hopeful and
encouraging in the opening of the new era, there is also not
a little to cause anxiety even to the most buoyant; and
problems have to be faced, which may affect not merely the
well-being, but the very existence of our Church and Empire.</p>

<p>‘And giving of thanks.’ Shall we not render that too?
Shall we not thank God that for more than three-and-sixty
years He gave us such a Queen?</p>

<p>I dare say many of us read with absorbing interest those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
extracts, covering the past century, which the <i>Times</i> reprinted
from its own columns at the end of the year. But, among all
those extracts, there was nothing, I think, more interesting
than to read the proclamation issued by the Queen at her
accession, three-and-sixty years before, and to note how
exactly her hopes and promises were fulfilled. It is one of
the sternest tests which can be applied to a life of any length.
To most of us, if confronted in middle or declining years with
the hopes and resolutions of our youth, would they not sound
more like sarcasms than like prophecies?</p>

<p>Lastly, let us remember, that every great life, and every
great example which is lived before us, brings with it a
corresponding weight of obligation and responsibility. Let
us pray with St. Ignatius that it may not turn to a witness
against ourselves: εὔχομαι ἵνα μὴ εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτὸ κτήσωνται<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_19">Page 19.</a> If the view taken in the text is correct, we might
borrow a phrase from the Saxon Chronicle, and say that Asser

<p><a href="#Page_28">Page 28.</a> The medical friend who is cited on <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a> has also
given me his opinion with reference to the passage in Asser
describing the mysterious disease with which Alfred was said to
have been attacked during his marriage festivities. He thinks the
malady indicated was probably stone in the bladder; and that it
possibly <i>was</i> connected with the ‘ficus’ from which Alfred is said
to have suffered. The latter was either piles or prolapsus of the
rectum, conditions often caused in the young by the straining
induced sympathetically by the presence of a stone in the
bladder. This makes the medical aspect of the case more intelligible. It
does not, however, affect the literary and historical inconsistencies
of the account which I have pointed out in the text.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_52">Page 52.</a> Opponents of the genuineness of Asser endeavour
to meet some of the arguments advanced in the text, by saying
that the forger made use of genuine documents. This does not
touch the argument from the unity of style and diction. Waiving
this, the difference between us is reduced to the question: Is
Asser a genuine work which has been largely interpolated? or is
it a spurious work embodying many genuine elements? The
former seems to me more probable. But thus stated, the question
rather resembles the famous problem in the <i>Oxford Spectator</i>,
whether a certain College ribbon was a blue ribbon with two
white stripes, or a white ribbon with three blue stripes. And
there I am content to leave the matter.</p>

has been investigated by Huber,
Johann Scotus Erigena, … München,
1861, pp. 108 ff., who rightly
regards it as baseless. Yet it still
hovers about; e.g. Draper, pp. 48,
49; Macfadyen, pp. 47-49. The
Bishop of Bristol seems to me a
little inconsistent, Essays, pp.
107 ff. Huber himself u. s. makes
the extraordinary statement that
the Preface to Alfred’s version of
the Pastoral Care is not extant.
As it had been printed at least
ten times before Huber’s book
appeared, he might have known
of its existence. On Erigena
there is an interesting letter by
William of Malmesbury, printed
in Stubbs’ edition, I. xliii ff.</p>

an interesting inscription found in

of the existence of a see at Exeter

of the inscription seems to me,
however, too uncertain to justify
me in making use of it. Lingard,

S. D.² used the original text of
Asser is shown by his having the
false reading ‘qui fuit Fingodwulf’
in Alfred’s pedigree, which
S. D.¹ omits and Florence corrects,
S. D. ii. 99; that he used S. D.¹ is
proved by the fact that under 853
they both have the false reading
‘Wada’ for the ‘Huda’ of Asser,
Florence, and the Chron., S. D.
ii. 71, 102; that he used Florence
is proved by the fact that he
gives the amount of Æthelwulf’s
Roman benefaction as ‘ccc mancusas
denariorum,’ ii. 103; where
the word ‘denariorum’ is from
Florence, and is not in Asser or
S. D.¹ Unfortunately Mr. Arnold
is very capricious in his use of
large and small type. He prints
in large type, as if original to

the Chronicle (Mercian Register);
in 906 according to MS. D. The
notice of St. Winnoc as ‘lord of
the minster of Wormhoult to the
south of the sea,’ p. 145, Nov. 6,
is also emphasised by Mr. Cockayne
as proving that the work is
earlier than 900, in which year
St. Winnoc’s body was translated
to Bergues. But this point, if
insisted on, would prove the work
to be earlier than 846. For in
that year St. Winnoc was translated
from Wormhoult to St.
Omer (<i>or</i> Sithiu). The translation
to Bergues in 900 was from
St. Omer, not from Wormhoult.
But an English writer might
easily be ignorant of either or
both these translations. It is
better therefore not to lay
stress on this point. See the
Life of St. Winnoc in Mabillon,
AA. SS. iii. 311, 312 (ed. 1672).
An English writer could hardly
however have been ignorant of
Oswald’s translation, if it had
taken place.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_194" id="Footnote_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> The special use of the term
‘Saxonia’ occurs only in the biography;
but then there was no
great occasion to use it in the
annals. Conversely, the seven
instances in which Welsh equivalents
for Saxon place-names are
given occur wholly in the annals.
But this also is quite natural.
In the annals, as we shall see,
the writer was translating; and
he added explanations to make
his text more intelligible to his
Welsh readers. For the same
reason, and also because of their
greater length, the biographical
sections give greater scope for the
author’s idiosyncrasies both of
diction and of style; and therefore
they naturally contain a number
of peculiarities which cannot be
paralleled in the annals.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_195" id="Footnote_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_195"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> The biographical sections (B)
occupy nearly twice as much
space as the annalistic (A). For
purposes of statistics it is hard to
draw the line exactly between
them, because, even in the annals,
there are small biographical insertions,
and it is difficult to know
under which head to class these.
The longer anecdotes about Æthelwulf,
Æthelbald, and Æthelred
I have counted as B. I give a
few statistics of the vocabulary.
It will be seen that some words
of frequent occurrence occur only
under one heading, and these
taken alone might support the
theory of a double authorship;
but I do not think they do. See
last note. Adunatus, A³, B¹;
aedificium (in special sense noted
in text), A¹, B³; aliquantulus, A¹,
B⁴; animose, A⁶; belligerare, A⁵,
B²; curtum, B⁶; incessabiliter,
B³; infatigabiliter, A² (the writer
is fond of words ending in -bilis,
-biliter); licentia (in sense of
<i>leisure</i>), B³; more aprino, B¹;
more lupino, A¹; more uulpino,
A¹; ordinabiliter, B⁶; testudo,
A¹, B²; uniuersitatis uia (i.e.
death), A⁶, B¹; ultramarinus,
A¹, B¹; uita praesens, B¹².</p>

‘Fastigium cristallinum rex Ethelwulfus
apposuit scrinio, in quo
nomen eius litteris aureis est
legere.’ In front were ‘ex solido
argento iactae imagines,’ i.e.
statuettes cast in solid silver; at
the back ‘leuato metallo miracula
figurauit,’ i.e. scenes representing
Aldhelm’s miracles. Does
‘metallo leuato’ mean that they
were engraved? or does it indicate
‘champlevé’ enamel? The
latter would be another link with
Alfred’s Jewel, though the enamel
of that is ‘cloisonné.’ Malmesbury
speaks in the present tense,
so that the shrine had survived
to his time; and he must have
seen it almost daily. In the

p. 257: ‘on Sc͠es Ælfeges dagen
þæs halgen biscopes.’ The absurdity
is hardly less if we suppose
the earlier Ælfheah to be
meant, 934-951. But the title of
‘Saint’ seems to show that the
later one is intended. If so, the
life cannot at any rate be earlier
than 1012. And this alone would
be fatal to Ælfric’s authorship, as
he was himself a personal friend
of this later Ælfheah, and could
not possibly have made such a
confusion; cf. Wülker, Grundriss,
p. 455.</p>

tempus et aetatem regnandi regiae
unctionis sacramento praeueniens,
sicut quondam Samuel puerum
Dauid, ita eum in regem …
consecrauit.’ Later writers made
much of this papal unction, saying
not merely that Alfred was
the first English king anointed
by the pope, which is true, but
that he was the first English
king who was ever anointed and
crowned, e.g. Thorn, in Twysden,
col. 1777; Rudborne, Ang. Sac. i.
201, 207: ‘ab ipso descendit
inunctio regum Angliae’; Chron.
Robert of Gloucester, p. 388: ‘so
þat, biuore him, pur king nas þer
non’; John de Oxenedes (who
puts the papal coronation after
Alfred’s accession to the throne!),
p. 3; Birch, ii. 256: ‘Alfredus
rex totius Anglie, primus coronatus’;
see the figure of Alfred
in MS. Cott. Claud. D. vi, given
in Draper, p. 130, where the
crown and ampulla evidently
allude to the Roman unction and
coronation. Nicolas Smith, titular
bishop of Chalcedon († 1655),
says: ‘hic solus ex omnibus
Angliae regibus Diadema et inaugurationem
sumpsit a Romano
Pontifice, ut agnoscunt Protestantes,’

I do not know whether modern
Roman controversialists derive
any satisfaction from the same
reflexion. If so, it would be a
pity to deprive them of it.</p>

without qualification. Mr. Conybeare
(u. s. p. 16) goes further,
and misrepresents even this poor
authority: ‘according to the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle it was on
the news of [Æthelbald’s] incestuous
union reaching Rome that
Leo “hallowed Alfred to king.”’
Æthelbald’s marriage is not mentioned
in any MS. of the Chronicle,
not even in F.</p>

taken strictly it would seem that
Æthelwulf placed the crown on
the head of his child bride. (The
marriage benediction of Judith
is in Bouquet, vii. 621, 622, and
is rather a satire on her subsequent
history.) So Charles the
Great crowned Louis the Pious

my forefathers granted me.’ The
Latin translator gives ‘principes’
for ‘yldran,’ a meaning which it
can have. He therefore naturally
took the sentence to refer to
Alfred’s election as king by the
Witan; and the rest may have
followed from this.</p>

every one of these three places,
(1) Ecgbryhtesstan, (2) Iglea, (3)
Ethandun, has been variously
identified. The following series
have been proposed—A. (1) Brixton,
(2) Clay Hill near Warminster,
(3) Edington; B. (as in the text);
C. (1) Bratton near Westbury,
(2) Highley Common near Melksham, (3) Heddington on the
Roman road from Bath to Marlborough.
Bratton seems to me
impossible on philological grounds.
Yatton has also been proposed
for Ethandun. Philologically it
is possible; (cf. Yarnton near
Oxford = Eardingtun) but its position
north-west of Chippenham is
against it.</p>

this with the passage cited

which Alfred had in getting
the fortifications constructed

<p><a name="Footnote_537" id="Footnote_537"></a><a href="#FNanchor_537"><span class="label">[537]</span></a> This name also comes from
Ethelwerd. Ramsay, Foundations
of England, i. 261, sees in
this the ancient name of Westminster;
and a writer in the
Athenaeum for June 15, 1901,
takes the same view still more
positively, saying that we shall
search the Colne in vain for an
island called Thorney. I imagine
we should search the neighbourhood
of Westminster with equally
little success; and if the name
has become extinct in one locality,
why not in the other? possibly
because the thorns have become
extinct which gave the name.
Ethelwerd <i>may</i> be mistaken as to
the name, but it is absolutely
certain that the island on which
the Danes were blockaded was
in the Colne: ‘hie flugon ofer
Temese, … þa up be Colne on
anne iggað. Þa besæt sio fierd

i.e. he conceives the two obstacles

it into three channels, which is
perfectly possible. Perhaps the
worthy archdeacon may even have
seen the remains of Alfred’s works.
But I cannot now take Steenstrup’s
view that this device may have
been suggested to Alfred by Orosius’
account of the capture of
Babylon by Cyrus, Lib. ii. c. 6.
That was effected by diverting
the course of the river, which
there is no reason to suppose that
Alfred attempted.</p>

language with that of the Angles
and Saxons was very close, and
they have certain marked characteristics
in common, pointing
to close neighbourhood of their
original abodes. Of English
dialects the Frisian is nearest to
Kentish, except in the northern
Frisian islands, where it seems
more akin to West-Saxon. I take
this from Siebs, Zur Gesch. der

for a reference to which I am
indebted to Professor Napier, who
tells me that in his judgement
Englishmen and Frisians would
be quite intelligible to one another
in the ninth century. There is
a sentence of Frisian in Pertz,

that Grimbald came to England
in consequence of the murder of
Fulk, archbishop of Rheims,
Pertz, xxv. 769; as the date of
this was 900, the date of Grimbald’s
arrival would be thrown to
the very end of Alfred’s reign.
The Liber de Hyda, p. 30, says
that Grimbald was sent for by
advice of Archbishop Æthelred.
This would make the invitation
at least as early as 889. And
the same authority, p. 35, places
his arrival in 885. But I do not
attach much weight to any of
these statements.</p>

Alfred omits the conquest of
Britain by Claudius (vii. 6), but
this may be, as Schilling suggests
(p. 21), from quasipatriotic motives,
because of the ease with
which the island was conquered.
He does however give it in the
Bede (H. E. i. 3), and this fact
might be used as an argument in
favour of the priority of the Bede
translation.</p>

(p. 59) that Alfred in the Orosius
never mastered the fact that a
Roman might have not merely
two but three names. So when
there are two consuls with three
names each, he either makes three
persons out of them with two
names each, e.g. 176, 32; 182,
5 &amp;c., or he omits the two last
names altogether, e.g. 202, 18;
204, 23 &amp;c. By the time he
reached the Boethius he had overcome
this difficulty. In two
places he says that Marcus was
called by another name Tullius,
and by a third name Cicero, xviii.

lingua Saxonica de Gestis Anglorum
… cuius copiam habui in
Prioratu Canonicorum de Suthwyk,’
Anglia Sacra, i. 183. This
is interesting as showing that
Saxon studies were not quite
extinct even in the fifteenth
century. It is also interesting,
because we can almost certainly
point to the very ‘copia’ used by
Rudborne. It is the Cotton MS.
Otho B. XI. This is now terribly
injured, owing to the great Cottonian
fire of 1731. But Wanley
(p. 219), who saw it when complete,
describes it as ‘exemplum antiquum
primitus Eccles. Beatae
Mariae de Suwika’ (Southwick,
Hants); cited, ed. Miller, I. xvi.
Rudborne also cites Alfred’s will,
p. 206, though this does not
agree with our copies.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_794" id="Footnote_794"></a><a href="#FNanchor_794"><span class="label">[794]</span></a> I have shown above, p. 145,
that there are certain words
characteristic of the earlier recension
of the Dialogues which the
reviser systematically alters into
others, <i>semninga</i> into <i>færinga</i>, <i>tid</i>
into <i>tima</i>, <i>ongitan</i> to <i>oncnawan</i>, &amp;c.
In the Bede I have noticed 32
instances of <i>semninga</i>, not one of
<i>færinga</i>; 90 of <i>tid</i>, none of <i>tima</i>;
10 of <i>ongitan</i>, 2 of <i>oncnawan</i>.
I do not pretend that my observations
are exhaustive. The
following words occur, so far as
I know, only in the Bede and in
the Dialogues (the references
are to the pages and lines of
Hecht’s and Miller’s editions
respectively):—ágendlíce = proprie,
D 264, 26; B 30, 10 (in the
sense of ‘arbitrarily’ it occurs
C. P. p. 144); allíc = catholicus,
D 237, 20; B 312, 31; ancerlíf,
D 210, 26; B 364, 30; brícsian,
D 343, 37; B 244, 22; camphád,
D 298, 8; B 480, 11; drihtenlíc,
D 309, 26; B 158, 10; eardunghús,
D 185, 16; B 366, 16; efenceasterwaran,
D 205, 1; B 62, 20; fordémedness,
D 235, 14; B 34, 5;
forsettan (in sense of ‘obstruct’)
D 258, 28; B 212, 16; fremsumlíce,
D 242, 10; B 184, 23; gefeolan,
D 336, 23; B 450, 28; gefremedness,
D 318, 15; B 32, 7;
gewinfullíc, D 222, 9; B 56, 9;
gýmeléasness, D 208, 4; B 242,
28; ungebrosnendlíc, D 233, 15;
B 378, 4; ungeæhtendlic, D 282,
21; B 84, 12. This list too might
be easily extended; and the whole
subject of the relation of the two
works is well worthy of further
examination. No doubt the resemblance
is partly due to the
similarity of their subject matter.
The likeness of the two originals
is also very strong in parts; so
much so indeed that I think that
Bede must, consciously or unconsciously,
have modelled his style
in the Hist. Eccl. on the Dialogues
of Gregory. Still the likeness
between the two translations is,
I think, greater than one would
expect in the case of two perfectly
independent translators, and
points to their having been produced
under similar influences.</p>

passive really is, in origin, an
impersonal active form, which
explains the (at first sight) strange
phenomenon that the ‘passive’
always takes an accusative after
it, see Zimmer, Keltische Studien,

362; so: prafost ⁊ regolweard,
360; prafost ⁊ ealdorman = propositi
232 (these three examples
refer to the prior or provost of a
monastery). In the Orosius we
have æðelingas = regii iuuenes,
44; ealdorman = praefectus, 60,
84; but the most interesting instance
is: Asiam [he] hæfde
Romanum to boclande geseald =
traditam per testamentum Romanis
Asiam, 224; cf. the Soliloquies,
p. 164: ‘ælcne man lyst
siððan he ænig cotlyf on his
hlafordes <i>læne</i> myd his fultume
getimbred hæfð, þæt he hine
mote hwilum þaron gerestan, …
oð þone fyrst þe he <i>bocland</i> ⁊ ece
yrfe þurh his hlafordes miltse
geearnige.’ At p. 176 of the same
work is a passage which perhaps
illustrates the date of the use of
seals in England, for I do not
think there is anything corresponding
to it in the original:
‘geþene nu gif ðines hlafordes
ærendgewrit ⁊ his insegel to
ðe cymð.’ Another interesting
passage illustrating the meeting of
the Witan, the gathering of the
fyrd, the king’s household, &amp;c., is
at p. 187: ‘geðenc nu hweðer
awiht manna cynges ham sece
þer ðær he ðonne on tune byð,
oððe his gemot, oððe his fyrd’ &amp;c.;
cf. also pp. 200, 204. It is worth
noting that the word ‘carcern,’
‘prison,’ occurs first in Alfred’s
Laws (see Schmid, Gesetze, Glossary,
s. v.), and is also of frequent
occurrence in his works, Past.
p. 329; Oros. p. 214; Boeth. i.
(pp. 7, 8), xviii. § 4 (p. 45), xxxvii.
§ 1 (p. 111); Solil. pp. 202, 203.
In the Psalter, which is possibly
by Alfred, we have mention of
the two <i>shires</i> of Judah and Benjamin,
ed. Thorpe, p. 113; cf.
ibid. 29 for an interesting reference
to measurement of land
with ropes. In the Dialogues
we have the following: geréfa =
praefectus, 340; = tribunus, 220;
geréfman = primarius, 222; = curialis,
308; geréfscír = locus praefectorum;
práfost = praepositus
(in monastic sense), 344; ealdorman
= comes, 220, 301. An interesting
word is wlíte-weorð,
literally ‘face-price’ = ransom,
179.</p>

2; Lib. IV. metr. 7. The reason
of this omission is probably due
to the fact, that in these three
instances Alfred’s prose translation
omits the formula with which
it generally introduces the Metra:
‘Then Wisdom began to sing.’
This has been made an argument
against Alfred’s authorship of the
Metra. But it is surely quite
possible that Alfred, coming back
to his work after some time (see
below, pp. 189 f.), and making his
alliterative version without fresh
reference to the Latin, should, in
the absence of the usual formula,
have overlooked the poetical
character of these sections. In
one case, Lib. I. metr. 7, the introductory
formula is wanting,
and yet the section exists in the
verse translation. But here the
poetical character of the section
is much more obvious, and it is
followed by a formula which often
follows the Metra, ‘then was
Wisdom silent for a while,’ c. vii.
ad init.; so cc. xvii. ad init., xxiv.
ad init., xxxix. §§ 2, 4, xli. § 2.
A still more frequent concluding
formula is ‘ða ongan he eft spellian.’</p>

Metra are said to show less accuracy
than the prose version,
viz. the making Ulysses king of
Thracia instead of Ithaca, and
calling Homer the <i>friend</i> as well
as the teacher of Virgil, are possibly
merely due to the needs of alliteration,
xxvi. 7; xxx. 3 (pp. 193,
203). Almost the only thing in
the Metra to which there is
nothing corresponding in the
prose version is the well-known
simile of the egg, xx. 169 ff. (p.
182), and this, though possibly
suggested by a commentary, is
thoroughly Alfredian. Editors
have, I think, unduly prejudiced
the question by either omitting
the Metra altogether (as Cardale,
who merely gives one as a specimen),
or printing them as a sort
of appendix at the end. It would
be fairer to print them in the
text in parallel columns with the
prose version, an arrangement
which would also greatly facilitate
the study of them. They have,
be it remembered, the authority
of the MS. which is by nearly 200
years the more ancient of the two.</p>

My own list was made independently.
Mr. Hubbard remarks that
in several cases a passage, which
is an addition to the original in
the ‘Blooms,’ corresponds with a
translated passage in the Boethius.
This seems to show that the
Anglo-Saxon Boethius was one
of the sources of the ‘Blooms,’
which must therefore be later
than the Boethius. There is a
dissertation by Hulme: Die
Sprache der altengl. Bearbeitung
der Soliloquien, Freiburg im
Breisgau, 1894; but it is purely
philological. A new edition of
the ‘Blooms’ may be expected
shortly from Mr. H. L. Hargrove
of Yale.</p>

with some critics the occurrence
of military operations in any
year as necessarily excluding all
literary activity in that year.
Considering Alfred’s energy, and
the fact that military operations
were to a large extent suspended
in the winter, the assumption
seems to me rather rash; Asser
distinctly says that Alfred carried
on his studies ‘inter omnia alia
mentis et corporis impedimenta,’
488 D [50]; and Alfred tells how
he began the Cura Pastoralis
‘ongemang oðrum mislicum ⁊

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
